### Key Findings (Active Users Only)
- **16.0% of converted users add a contact** (vs 2.1% non-converted) = **7.6x lift** ⭐⭐⭐ (highest!)
- **24.0% of converted users add a job** (vs 6.3% non-converted) = **3.8x lift** ⭐⭐
- **28.0% of converted users complete a lesson** (vs 8.5% non-converted) = **3.3x lift** ⭐⭐
- **12.0% of converted users create a portfolio** (vs 6.3% non-converted) = **1.9x lift**
- **24.0% of converted users analyze their resume** (vs 21.8% non-converted) = **1.1x lift** (weak signal)

**Key Insight:** The product has multiple activation paths. Contacts shows the highest lift (7.6x) but lowest completion rate (16%). Jobs and Lessons both show strong signals (3.8x and 3.3x) with higher completion rates (24% and 28%).

## Activation Moments: Multiple Paths to Conversion

### Primary Activation: Adding a Contact (7.6x lift)

**Why Contacts is the Strongest Signal:**
1. **Highest Predictive Signal (7.6x lift)**
   - 16.0% of active users add contacts vs only 2.1% non-converted
   - Massive differentiation - active users are 7.6x more likely to add contacts
   - Represents commitment to networking/job search workflow

2. **Represents Core Value**
   - Adding contacts shows user is actively job searching
   - Indicates they're using the product for its primary purpose
   - Creates network effect and ongoing engagement

3. **Causal Link**
   - Users who add contacts are actively managing their job search
   - This active engagement likely drives conversion
   - Shows product is essential to their workflow

**Limitation:** Only 16% of active users add contacts (low completion rate)

### Secondary Activation: Adding a Job (3.8x lift)

**Why Jobs is Strong:**
1. **Strong Predictive Signal (3.8x lift)**
   - 24.0% of active users add jobs vs 6.3% non-converted
   - Higher completion rate than contacts (24% vs 16%)
   - Shows user is actively tracking applications

2. **Represents Active Job Search**
   - Adding jobs indicates serious job search intent
   - Creates ongoing engagement (tracking, updates, etc.)
   - Ties into other features (resume customization, company research)

### Tertiary Activation: Completing a Lesson (3.3x lift)

**Why Lessons is Strong:**
1. **Strong Predictive Signal (3.3x lift)**
   - 28.0% of active users complete lessons vs 8.5% non-converted
   - **Highest completion rate** of all strong signals (28%)
   - Most accessible activation moment

2. **Represents Educational Value**
   - Shows user values the educational content
   - Creates habit formation
   - Demonstrates product delivers on promise

### Why NOT Resume Analysis?

**Resume Analysis (1.1x lift):**
- ❌ Minimal differentiation (24% vs 21.8%)
- ❌ Almost as many non-converted users analyze resume
- ❌ Weak predictive signal for actual payment
- ✅ May help with trial conversion but doesn't predict payment

**Note:** When including trial users, resume analysis showed 2.5x lift, suggesting it may help users start trials but doesn't predict actual payment conversion.

### Why NOT Other Actions?

**Onboarding Completion (87.9% of converted users):**
- ❌ Too high - likely correlation, not causation
- ❌ Most users complete it, so it doesn't differentiate
- ❌ Setup task, not value delivery

**Lesson Completion (5.2x lift but only 24.1% do it):**
- ❌ Too low completion rate - not accessible enough
- ❌ Happens later (11.7 hours average)
- ❌ Requires more commitment upfront

**Portfolio Creation (5.5x lift but only 15.5% do it):**
- ❌ Too low completion rate
- ❌ More advanced feature, not early activation

**Resume Creation (1.7x lift):**
- ❌ Lower lift than analysis
- ❌ Setup task, not value delivery

## Recommendations

### 1. Optimize for Multiple Activation Paths

**Strategy:** Support multiple activation moments based on user intent

#### A. Contacts Activation (7.6x lift, 16% completion)
**Target:** Increase to 30%+ of signups adding contacts within 7 days

**Tactics:**
- Make contact discovery/adding prominent in onboarding
- Show value of contact management early (e.g., "Track who you've talked to")
- Integrate with job applications (auto-suggest contacts at companies)
- Add quick-add contact flow from job pages
- Email sequence: "Start building your network" (Day 2-3)

#### B. Jobs Activation (3.8x lift, 24% completion)
**Target:** Increase to 40%+ of signups adding jobs within 7 days

**Tactics:**
- Make job tracking the default dashboard view
- Add "Add Your First Job" prominent CTA after onboarding
- Show job tracking value immediately (e.g., "Track 3 jobs to see insights")
- Integrate with resume customization (show jobs when customizing)
- Email sequence: "Track your applications" (Day 1-2)

#### C. Lessons Activation (3.3x lift, 28% completion)
**Target:** Increase to 50%+ of signups completing a lesson within 7 days

**Tactics:**
- Make first lesson required or heavily promoted in onboarding
- Show lesson preview/content immediately after onboarding
- Remove gates/barriers to first lesson (make it free/preview)
- Auto-play or prominently feature first lesson on dashboard
- Email sequence driving to first lesson completion
- Use resume analysis results to recommend specific lessons

### 2. Improve Onboarding → Analysis Flow

**Current Flow Issues:**
- Onboarding takes 3.4 hours (too long?)
- Gap between onboarding (3.4h) and analysis (10.2h) = 6.8 hours
- Opportunity to reduce this gap

**Optimization:**
- Embed resume upload/analysis directly in onboarding
- Show analysis results immediately after onboarding
- Use analysis results to personalize next steps

### 3. Test Causal Impact

**A/B Test:**
- **Control:** Current flow (onboarding → optional analysis)
- **Variant:** Force resume analysis before dashboard access
- **Metric:** Day 7 retention and trial conversion

**Hypothesis:** Forcing resume analysis will increase conversion by 2-3x

### 4. Secondary Activation: Lesson Completion

While resume analysis is primary, lesson completion shows 5.2x lift:
- Only 24.1% of converted users complete lessons
- Opportunity to increase this after resume analysis
- Use resume analysis results to recommend specific lessons

## Data Quality Notes

- **Sample Size:** 167 users (25 active/paid, 142 non-converted)
- **Time Period:** Last 90 days
- **Conversion Definition:** Only `active` subscription status (excludes `trialing`)
- **Limitations:**
  - Small sample size for active users (n=25) - results may change with more data
  - Early-stage product (low event volumes in Amplitude)
  - Some actions may not be fully tracked yet
  - Correlation ≠ causation (need A/B testing to validate)
  - Trial users (33) excluded from "converted" - they may convert later

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Immediate:** Make resume analysis required in onboarding
2. ✅ **Week 1:** A/B test forced vs optional resume analysis
3. ✅ **Week 2:** Add email sequence driving to resume analysis
4. ✅ **Week 3:** Measure impact on Day 7 retention and conversion
5. ✅ **Ongoing:** Track activation rate as primary north star metric
