There’s some opportunity to slightly upgrade softer openings like \"Created\" or \"Built out\" to more strategic verbs (e.g., \"Drove,\" \"Owned,\" \"Orchestrated\") and to vary language between similar bullets, but overall the verb quality is excellent.",
          "accomplishments": "The resume is heavily accomplishment-driven, with nearly every bullet tying to an outcome: increased conversion, ARR, enterprise contracts, app ratings, or user behaviors. You clearly frame launches and changes in terms of what they achieved, not just what you did, which is ideal for PM roles. A minor enhancement would be to more clearly distinguish accomplishments by level (APM vs PM vs Lead PM) to better showcase career progression.",
          "quantification": "Your quantification is outstanding: 44% increase in account creation, 60% subscription rate lift, 38% more users posting content, 47% trial-to-subscription lift, 130% increase in payment connections, $1.2MM+ ARR, 5x Enterprise ARR, 19% checkout conversion lift, 132% more event shares, 44% fewer support inquiries, and concrete user counts. Almost every bullet has a number. You could layer in a few more scale metrics (e.g., size of user base or revenue segment) to give even more context, but the baseline is already very strong.",
          "impact": "Business and user impact is clearly and consistently demonstrated: you tie features to revenue, conversion, enterprise growth, user engagement, and support cost reduction. You show impact across multiple dimensions—ARR, contracts, ratings, behavioral changes—which paints you as a high-leverage PM. Clarifying the strategic significance of a few wins (e.g., first standalone product, enterprise move, creator economy positioning) would further reinforce your ability to drive company-level outcomes.",
          "conciseness": "Bullets are generally concise, direct, and free of filler, making the resume very scannable for a senior PM. There is some repetition between roles (especially the duplicated Squarespace sections) and a few longer bullets that could be split or tightened slightly. With minor pruning and differentiation between roles, you could raise conciseness further without losing any substance."
