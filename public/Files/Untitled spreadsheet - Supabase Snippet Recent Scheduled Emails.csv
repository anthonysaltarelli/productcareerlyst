36d9bd161adb4497989a4f2c2616ee9d,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over the side projects section of your product portfolio. So the side project section on your homepage, the purpose is really to demonstrate your PM skill set and initiative. 0:13 It really proves that you have the PM skills necessary and knowledge necessary to be effective in that role at a company. 0:21 It highlights your versatility and adaptability and it showcases creativity and problem solving abilities. So components are very similar here to the other sections where you'll have a project name, graphic description and a button linking out to a specific page for it. 0:39 So selecting side projects for inclusion here. You want to choose relevant projects that you've worked on in the past that highlight your skills. 0:48 You want projects with tangible results or impact and you want to prioritize recent projects to show current expertise. So when you're listing out the projects in this section, from left to right, it should be newest to oldest. 1:04 In terms of creating the individual project pages, I think it's good to use a consistent format for each project so that when someone is going from project to project, it's very easy for them to wrap their head around what they're actually looking at. 1:18 So in the header section, you'd have a title, dates, background image, and short description, and then the body section would include a project overview, the process for your project, and the ultimate results. 1:33 In terms of diving in deep there, so the overview section would explain the problem or opportunity addressed, describe the target audience or market, and really highlight the key features or functionality for that side project. 1:48 The process would go through kind of outlining the product development process that you went through to get there It'll describe your role and responsibilities You may want to explain the tools and methodologies you used and then finally results It would be great to share quantifiable results or success 2:06 metrics Including user testimonials if they are available and any lessons learned that you had and how you're going to apply them to future projects In terms of visual elements, it's great to use screenshots, mock-ups, or prototypes to showcase the project. 2:26 It would be great to include graphs or charts when applicable to display quantitative data. You may also want to ensure visual elements that are clear and easy to understand. 2:39 And in general, effective product managers create beautiful simple experiences. So make sure your project visuals look sharp because companies will want to hire people who can actually create these beautiful simple experiences for them. 2:55 So the best way to demonstrate that is just by doing it on your portfolio. Here are a couple of best practices for these pages. 3:02 So you want to keep the project descriptions concise and focused. You want to use clear non-technical language so that any viewer can actually understand it. 3:12 And you want to highlight transferable skills and experiences. So on the right, if you want to pause through and read these, here are a couple transferable skills that would be great to highlight on these side project pages to really demonstrate your ability to hit the ground running when you join the 3:31 company. And then a quick example for my portfolio. I have a couple side projects that I kind of worked on here, and if we click into view one, again my product portfolio is a little bit different than the one you may have because I'm already a product manager. 3:49 So I have it trimmed down to just demonstrating the features that I built and launched. So this is for a food app that I launched in New York City, this is the Discover page, this highlights the restaurant details page, and so again with all of this, I'm demonstrating my ability to ship features and 4:10 functionality that are solving problems for users. So the problem here and pointing out is that we're making it easier for users to see what reservation and delivery options a restaurant has available. 4:24 So this is the kind of way that you would be able to go through different projects that you've done in the past on the side and demonstrate them in a nice visual way that represents your skillset well to a future employer.","Learn how to select and structure side projects in your product portfolio with consistent pages, visuals, and metrics so you can demonstrate PM skills to employers.",9df9df0d-7611-476f-98b9-cafdac4d397f,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Side Projects,10,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:54.007394+00
a91405ac09c845f6a0407af1141c02a9,"0:00 This is going to be a pretty short lesson on the contact page. So, what to include here? You can keep this page short and sweet it's really just a way for people to get in touch with you. 0:11 You want to include a link to your LinkedIn page so that they can view your LinkedIn and how you have all of your past experiences represented there. 0:20 And, optionally, you can include your email, but you guys should at least have the contact form that helps people get in touch with you. 0:27 So this is what it looks like on on mine. You can obviously customize this a little bit. You should add your photo, and then you should set up this form so that when people enter it and submit, it goes straight to your email. 0:41 And then again, I'm linking out to different social media profiles that I want potential visitors of my site to actually access. 0:49 So this is a quick little lesson on the contact page. You should definitely keep it up top. And then also you can link to it from the AboutMe section here. 1:00 So this links right to the ContactMe page, making it easy for potential visitors to actually get in touch with you.","Learn how to create a contact page with a form, photo, and LinkedIn link so you can make it easy for visitors to reach you.",52610ea9-9d57-4ab5-a661-a5a2546c2b78,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Contact,11,TRUE,2,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:54.488638+00
785774349b14430588a326a3d024002d,"0:00 In this lesson, I wanted to go through putting everything together that you've done into your actual online portfolio. So, once you actually gain access to the duplicated Squarespace template again, details to that are in the initial emails that you got when you sign up for the course 0:19 you will create a Squarespace account and it will look like this when you click on pages. Note that the trial is 14 days long, so So you'll have 14 days to work on your kind of portfolio before it asks you to subscribe and just quickly to show you the prices. 0:39 The personal plan is $16 a month if you pay annually or $23 a month if you pay per month. You can decide maybe you just want to pay while your job hunting and do the $23 per month or you want to just have this up throughout the year for your job searching and professional kind of presence online. 1:02 So basically the goal here is to make sure that the ultimate portfolio that you end up with looks super clean, it's customized to you so that people get a sense of who you are, what you've worked on in the past and everything links well together. 1:20 So, basically what you'll do here is you'll go in and you will click on different things like photos and you'll replace them. 1:28 You'll go into the sections and add in your name here. You'll go into the experience section and update these to be your experiences. 1:37 So what places you've worked at, your titles and the date ranges. Here is a social links block. So you'll actually go in and add social links if you want. 1:47 Or if you don't you can delete this and expand the line here One thing to note when you're going through this is up here is where you can toggle between desktop view and mobile view So when you make edits, you'll want to make sure that they look good in both desktop and mobile So as you're going through 2:05 again You're going to want to customize all this information, but I kept it here to make it really easy for you to just kind of replace text and and link new different things together. 2:16 So in this section is where you'll have your work and my work side projects and case studies are in a very similar format to one another. 2:25 We have the kind of title here and image a subtext and then the button. So what you're gonna wanna do is you're gonna update to this to your company in the figment training I'll show you how to create logos like this, logo images. 2:41 You're gonna wanna say what position you actually had at the company and then a link. And the link should go to the specific page. 2:50 So for me, that means grow therapy is the page. But for you, you'll update the actual URL. Now, say you've only worked at three companies. 3:00 You can select these and delete it. And then, what you would do is you would move over the experiences so that they're spaced out a little bit better. 3:09 When you're doing this, one tip is to click the G key. It will highlight the kind of boxes here where you can move stuff to and basically we just want to see consistent spacing. 3:22 So in this example there's two boxes in between each one so we have good spacing there. Now say you only worked at two places you can delete another and move this over to the right and then you have the opportunity to increase the width of this, increase the width here and then maybe move up the button 3:42 . So, as you can see, depending on the amount of positions you've had, you can update this to look cleaner and look like it fits the space better. 3:56 But I'll leave it here with four positions, just to make it easy to go from that down to fewer ones. 4:04 Same thing for side projects, et cetera. You want to customize each section, of course, to your actual experience. When you're finished making edits, make sure to always go up here to done and click the save button to actually save your changes. 4:18 In this case, I do not want to save these changes, so I'm going to save discard changes and just confirm that there. 4:25 So on the left here, you have the navigation, so you can get in between the homepage, which is linked down here, and the individual pages for work, per side projects, and case studies as well as the contact page. 4:39 And for all of these, you're going to want to customize them all. So, Squarespace does not duplicate certain images, so you're going to want to go here and click on this section, click the edit button and add an image here. 4:54 And what I recommend is clicking browse stock images, and you can search for any free image out there that relates to the company that you're working on. 5:04 So, say you're doing a case study for Airbnb, you can either try searching Airbnb and And then boom, you've got a great free image that you can use and it loads it in from unsplash. 5:16 Then what I recommend is to go to design and make sure that it's not under fit, it's fill. So now you have a beautiful background here. 5:25 You can kind of go in and change this to Airbnb and then change the logo as well. So edit this, replace it, et cetera, again in the in the training I go into that and then in the sections here you'll want to obviously update the projects that you've worked on. 5:46 One tip is if you want to easily duplicate the section, you can just click this duplicate button and it will just create a new section right below. 5:55 You can then edit the section and change the colors if you want. So maybe you want to make this this background or color scheme this one or this one, et cetera, you can make all those adjustments as you'd like. 6:08 Again, go up here to save the changes. In this case, I'm going to discard the changes. Another thing that you need to do is make sure that you're changing the actual titles of these pages. 6:19 So, you can do that by clicking the gear icon, changing the title. So, this one could say Airbnb. I would change it to Airbnb in the navigation as well. 6:27 And I would change it in the URL So I click save, and then to make sure that things are working properly, I'd make sure that any place where I'm actually linking to that page. 6:40 For example, right here, I would update that, select the link option here, click the gear icon, go to page, backslash, Airbnb. 6:52 So now when I, when a user clicks on that link right there, it'll go to the correct page. I would do that here as well, so I would go to the gear icon, click page, X this out, and click Airbnb. 7:07 So basically you're going to want to do this for all the different options here, and make sure that when you're doing a pass through all the links are going to the correct place, and you've updated all the titles for the navigation as well. 7:21 That will look like this when you hover over As you can see under work, it's now Airbnb instead of grow therapy. 7:29 So you want to make sure that all of these are actually updated. Contact is another one that you want to update. 7:35 So when you go here and click on to the form, you'll click edit. And then you go to storage. And this will be an email address. 7:46 It may be my email address because I'm sharing the template with you. But you'll want to put in your email address here to make sure that you are the one actually getting these form results to your inbox directly. 7:59 And then you'll want to update the image here. And if you have other information like a LinkedIn, you'll put that in the social links here. 8:08 You know, you'll do LinkedIn dot com slash, etc. So you'll click down again and save it. So that is an overview of the Squarespace platform, what you kind of need to do to create your product portfolio on here. 8:27 Again, when you are finished, please submit it for review by me. I will go through and give you pretty detailed notes on exactly what I think you should improve on or areas of our opportunity. 8:41 Additionally, make sure that you're going in between desktop view and mobile view here. So that you can see what it looks like on both services. 8:49 It should, for the most part, work and be optimized to both desktop and mobile web, but just double check for sure. 8:58 And then the final thing will be when you are ready to actually launch this site, you'll wanna get a domain. 9:06 And I recommend, in as many cases as possible, doing your full name.com. If it's available, you can also play around with different variations of it to get a great domain that you can then put on your resume, your LinkedIn, and send in emails as well. 9:24 So you'll want to domain that looks good and looks professional, etc. If you have any questions at all about putting together the site, issues that you're running into, etc, please let me know either by email or in the Slack community and I will get those questions answered for you.","Learn how to customize a duplicated Squarespace template into a polished portfolio with updated pages, links, contact form, and mobile/desktop checks so you can launch a professional site.",dcd81089-02b5-4b4a-8e0d-1491b8b9502a,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Putting it All Together,12,TRUE,10,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:55.061178+00
fcdf16f50e03404192de4e126d9dc664,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to share how you can actually use your portfolio to stand out in the job application process So you've built your portfolio, it looks beautiful, it's live, here are the actual next steps So the first is using it in networking, the next is integrating it into your LinkedIn and 00:21 Resume, and the third is including it in job applications So networking, this is a huge portion of how you're actually going to leverage your product portfolio to stand out in the application process. 00:35 So you can link to your product portfolio whenever you reach out to a hiring manager or employee at the company you want to work at. 00:44 Out of curiosity, they will most likely click to view it. So if someone sends a message and says, you know, check out my portfolio, and the URL is their fullname.com, you know, the likelihood that they actually click on that just out of curiosity is high, and then once they land there, they'll be super 01:03 impressed, and the chance that they actually respond are much higher. So when you're reaching out and networking with people, which is really critical to getting a job and getting an interview in the first place, you want to make sure you have a clear call to action and try not to make it too time-consuming 01:21 for them. So an example of this is a short call or answering quick questions over LinkedIn or email. The resource that I've included in this program is here and you can look through this to actually get scripts for what you should say when you're reaching out to these people on LinkedIn or email. 01:42 So for example number one here reach out to someone with no connections. So this would be someone on LinkedIn where I literally have zero connections to them. 01:52 So what I would do is I would go to LinkedIn and I would search for probably Airbnb. And then I would click people and then I would go to all filters and I would type down here the title of product manager. 02:10 Now I'm going to show the results so there's 486 results here. So, a lot of them I have second connections to, meaning I have a mutual connection. 02:23 And outside of that, we might have third connection. So, these are some examples here. So I have zero connections to this person, so they're considered a third plus connection. 02:36 So I would actually go to them and message them and say, you know, for this one, hey, Janine, I hope you don't mind reaching out. 02:44 I'm interested in Airbnb and came across your profile saw you you know interesting thing now down here I have a couple of ideas for the interesting thing section so maybe they wrote a blog post about a particular topic and I thought it was super interesting maybe you're looking at their their job history 03:03 and you see that they transitioned from sales into product and you thought that was super interesting or um you know you saw they put together a list of their favorite books on Twitter and you may have loved one of those books. 03:16 So kind of dive into the person that you're actually reaching out to and really customize this message because these people get messages all the time from people who want to join their company. 03:28 And if you add some personalization to the message, the chances that you actually get a response are much higher. Then the next section here is, would you be willing to answer a couple quick questions I had about Airbnb? 03:41 Happy to set up a short call or send some questions over LinkedIn whatever is easiest. By the way, if you want to check out some of my past work, here's my site. 03:49 This is where you would enter your portfolio link and then sign it off with your name. And then this is, you know, the section where the person you're trying to connect with is going to have curiosity and click out to view your portfolio. 04:04 Now down here, reaching out to someone with mutual connections, if you actually know the connection, the mutual connection. You can mention them in this section. 04:14 Otherwise, I would just opt towards this first this first script. So, hey Janine, I hope you don't mind me reaching out. 04:22 I'm interested in Airbnb and so you're connected with Bill. We used to do something together. Maybe we worked at a former company together or went to school together, etc. 04:32 And then a similar section down at the bottom. And then reaching out to a first connection. So, this is if you actually know the person, maybe you're not super close or friends with them, but you definitely know them. 04:45 So you might say, hey, you know, Amy, how's it been since we worked at XYZ company together or since college, et cetera? 04:55 I'm interested in Airbnb and remember you've been there for a couple months or a couple of years. And then the same kind of linking to your portfolio, asking them that call to action. 05:05 So, again, some of these interesting ideas down here, and in terms of what I recommend here, I would say definitely try to find the person's email and send them an email directly. 05:19 There's a much higher chance that they read it over email, especially if it's like a work email, compared to LinkedIn. 05:25 And if you're reaching out over email, definitely include your portfolio on LinkedIn underneath your name. Like this. look forward to hearing from you, Anthony Salterelli, and then these are the links to my portfolio and LinkedIn so that it just gives them really easy access to discovering them. 05:41 One tip to getting the actual email address of the person that you want to be reaching out to is installing this Chrome extension called WIZA. 05:51 You can just search it on the internet, we're going to WIZA.co and basically what it does is it adds these buttons onto a person's profile and also this little widget here. 06:02 And you can actually reveal their contact info. So it'll take all the information they have from different data sources and and try to present you with the email address. 06:12 Sometimes it won't be correct, but a lot of the time it will be. And it does come included with some some free credit. 06:19 So I recommend finding someone's email address directly and emailing them just because the chances that they look at it over LinkedIn are a little bit higher. 06:28 But you can You can definitely email them and send a LinkedIn message, potentially if they don't respond after a couple days, you can follow up with them over LinkedIn. 06:37 That's what I recommend for getting their actual email address and emailing them directly. In terms of people that you want to contact, I recommend really focusing your efforts on product management and product design. 06:52 So the kind of individual contributor level you have product manager, senior product manager, staff product manager, so that's when I was going to these key words and typing in here. 07:05 Another option is director product or VP of product, so I can change this to director of product and show the results. 07:14 So we actually have 84 director of products at Airbnb and all of these people are typically the ones hiring for their teams VP of product chief product officer if it's a smaller company and you might be able to stand out that way It's also valuable to reach out to product design people so product designers 07:35 seeing your product designers staff Directors VPs again because product design works incredibly close with product management They complement each other really well. 07:47 So they're always looking for great candidates. So I kind of went through that example search on the LinkedIn over here. 07:55 Now, in terms of your LinkedIn and resume, so you should definitely put the link to your portfolio at the top of your resume. 08:02 Make it a hyperlink so that the hiring managers can easily click on it from the PDF and I like to remove the underline, that's a personal preference just to keep it clean, but you can always keep it. 08:15 But when the hiring manager is reviewing your PDF, they'll hover their mouse over the actual portfolio link. It'll appear to be clickable, they'll click on it and it'll go straight to your portfolio. 08:28 And then I also think it is really important to add a link to your portfolio on your LinkedIn itself. So, add a featured card section here where you're linking out to the portfolio and saying check out some press projects I've worked on or whatever description you kind of want here. 08:46 And then in the about section, make it right at the top. Check out my portfolio because the portfolio is going to be the best way to visually represent your skillset and everything that a hiring manager may need to know, it should be on your portfolio. 09:01 Now, in job applications, when companies ask for it, always include a link to your LinkedIn and your portfolio within the website section. 09:12 So this is obviously all required, but this is a great area to just drop in your portfolio because this may, you know, most people aren't doing this because they don't have a portfolio. 09:25 It's just one additional way to stand out in the traditional application process. Now, I recommend, again, reaching out and networking with people at the company before getting to that stage because ultimately you want them to get on a call with you so that you can eventually get a referral from them 09:43 . But if you're not having luck hearing back from certain people and you just want to apply to the role, this is a great place to include the portfolio. 09:53 And then even if you're being referred for a position, you probably still have to fill out a job application so definitely still include the portfolio in the application for a referral even though you already included it when you reached out to the connection. 10:08 So that kind of summarizes how you can actually leverage your product portfolio when it comes to networking, putting it on your LinkedIn and resume and including it in job applications. 10:19 The goal really is that in as many cases as possible you're getting this portfolio in front of the eyes of potential hiring managers. 10:29 So the more places that you can include it and incorporate it into the higher your chances are to actually stand out in that application process amongst those hundreds of applications that these hiring managers are getting.","Learn how to leverage your portfolio in networking outreach, LinkedIn, your resume, and applications so you can increase responses and stand out to hiring managers.",f0407901-bd49-4749-adf3-cd84c812b535,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Using your Portfolio to stand out,13,TRUE,11,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:55.823855+00
d0337ecb86454ef3a9a0d7c2abf47c23,"0:00 In this lesson, I wanted to give a brief overview of how you can use Figma, which is a free design tool that you can download for your computer or you can access it online as well, um, to make some of the nice graphics that appear on your portfolio. 0:14 So, one thing to note is that for a lot of the sections on the homepage, we're following this kind of format, 8.52 x 488, it doesn't have to be those exact dimensions, but what we do is we get the logo of the company that you worked at, we're placing it inside of this frame. 0:35 And then in the case of Squarespace, it's pretty easy, we're just selecting the fill of the entire container to be the same color as what's in the logo itself. 0:46 So as you can imagine, you know, say you have, you're doing another logo and what the logo you're working on, the main color of the company is this red. 0:58 What you'll, what it'll look like is you'll kind of copy and paste the logo into here. Then you'll click logo to view the whole frame, click fill, and then use the eye drop tool to select that red, and then it just fills in the rest of the frame with the color so that it just looks like it's a nice presentation 1:19 of the actual logo. In this case, when you're actually creating the individual job pages, you'll want it in a square format, in some cases, so you'll create that same logo and just put it in a square frame, in this case, A52 by A52. 1:37 Once you're ready to export it, what you'll do is select the frame, so logo. Go down here, I think 2x PNG is pretty sufficient, but if you want, you could do 4x. 1:49 It just basically increases the size and the quality of the photo. Click to export it. You could also see down here what it will look like when you actually export, and then you can save it to your computer. 2:01 Right here, I demonstrate and have a template for a user journey. So what you could do is you could go in and change this to, you know, a different user. 2:12 You could change the scenario. You can change the expectations here. And then what you can do is go through these steps here and update each step. 2:24 And then the quotes that are associated with each step. So you may want to replace this quote with something else like how can I find an apartment Tuesday and and then you can kind of use these shapes and just increase the size of them and you may need to play around with this a little bit and it takes 2:47 some time to get used to but once you get the hang of it you should be able to manipulate it and everything here is easily movable. 2:55 So, you could, you know, completely delete this section. So, this and this and decrease the kind of journey line here. 3:06 So, it looks something like that. You can select all these and kind of increase the width here. So, there's a lot of flexibility when it comes to Figma. 3:15 And, but I will provide kind of this outline for you. So, what you can end up doing is duplicating this page itself and then going in and editing however you'd like to edit. 3:31 Down here I just have a couple examples of graphics I'm using for side projects so you'll want to make sure that when you create these images they're nicely centered within the frame itself and they're displaying what's necessary to display. 3:50 I like to keep each section consistent. So all the logos have a similar format where it's the logo and then the outside is the same color as the logo for side projects, more of like a visual for all of them. 4:06 And then for case studies, I have this black background with these screenshots that I placed in here. A lot of the time it's really nice to add a corner radius, which what it it's called onto these images so right here I have it set to 40 as you can see if I change it to 0 so this image already has a 4:31 radius built in but in certain cases they don't and we can we can look here actually so the corner radius determines like how rounded this edge actually is so if we want it updated to say 30, it would increase the corners here. 4:52 So it's nice when doing screenshots to give it a good corner radius so it really looks like a modern day iPhone. 4:59 So that is kind of the basics of Figma again, you'll want to play around with the kind of alignment, the colors and the fill here. 5:09 You can click to update the text in the user journey when you're ready to export. I would, you know, depending on the page you're presenting it on, I either click to show the fill the background this white background in the export or uncheck. 5:25 As you can see down here that determines like whether or not the background is transparent or not. So if you're dropping this onto a page on your portfolio that doesn't, you know, that has a different color background than white. 5:42 you may want to export it without the white background so that it is that it cleanly looks and fits on to your page. 5:50 But then you would just click export user journey and you would save it to your drive to your computer. So that is kind of an overview of how to use Figma in a kind of basic way to create some of the graphics for your product portfolio. 6:05 I also wanted to just quickly share what you'll do when you gain access to this Figma file. You'll create an account on Figma if you don't have one already, you will click this little drop down here and say duplicate to your drafts. 6:18 Then it will actually duplicate this file, you can go ahead and open that, and now you have the ability to actually edit this file for yourself. 6:27 You can copy things, you can paste them, and continue to use the file as you would normally. So there you go, that's how you will duplicate your your Figma file to edit yourself.","Learn how to create and export consistent portfolio graphics in Figma using frames, fills, and templates so you can produce polished images for your portfolio pages.",37d9f383-f6fa-43e0-ba9a-ccc51827ce83,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Figma 101 for creating graphics,14,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:56.306107+00
6059fb9aed5c43edb67a12f0f2e8fa9c,"00:00 In this lesson I wanted to do a deep dive in one of the case study that's on my portfolio. This is for uber eats and it's titled Bringing the Magic of Uber to Packaged Meals. 00:10 So, the kind of reason that I created this case study was actually for an interview process for uber eats itself and I decided to put the case study on my site so that other hiring managers could actually see the work that was put into this. 00:25 So, in this section, I'm going over context. Here I decide to create a nice graphic that really kind of sets the stage for what is it like to eat in the United States, like what options do people have. 00:40 I created this kind of chart where more convenient is on the excess and sorry convenience is on the excess going from less to more and then whether or not the food is prepared or not is on the y-axis. 00:55 So unprepared food is down here. That's where you actually have to prepare it yourself versus prepared food is up here. 01:01 That's like eating out restaurant demand delivery, et cetera. So I point out that Uber has already developed solutions for three of these categories of eating on-demand restaurant delivery, eating out and ordering pickup online at grocery delivery as well. 01:19 And I aim to kind of answer the question of whether or not Uber should build a solution for a fourth way of eating which is packaged meal delivery. 01:28 So this is like freshly where they send you a couple of meals that are frozen or refrigerated and you put them in the freezer and then when you're ready you heat it in two to three minutes. 01:40 So I really like to include a graphic here in this section to supplement the text just because it's a lot more visually interesting and helps people better understand like what are we actually focusing on. 01:54 Now the hypothesis I chose is that if UberEats offers packaged meal delivery, then they will increase retention amongst their user base. 02:03 Now the reason I chose this hypothesis was actually because the position that I was applying for was on the retention team itself. 02:12 So I knew that was something that they were looking for in this case study and it kind of intuitively make sense. 02:20 Packaged meals are typically ordered in bulk. So hypothetically, if someone is a freshly subscription, they're going to get it every week. 02:29 So if Uber eats integrated it, the hypothesis is that it will increase retention for their users. So next I went into the market. 02:39 So I first looked at where is the packaged meal heat and meat market headed. I included this because it maps well to these charts that I found online and I basically am demonstrating that the heat and eat meal kit market is going to grow at a much faster rate than online food delivery market. 02:59 So this is a strong signal for Uber Eats integrating the kind of this heat and eat segment into their product because they obviously don't want to just grow at this rate. 03:12 They want to grow it and increase straight. So, there's a lot of demand here for these types of services, like freshly, factor, or chef. 03:20 And by, you know, including these graphics and including this line, it's demonstrating that, hey, like if Uber wants to have continued strong growth, this is a great opportunity for the company to invest in too. 03:34 Then, here, I wanted to kind of do some research on what is the the heat and heat actually looked like today. 03:43 So there were a couple, five that I found that were pretty popular. Freshly I think is the most well-known as well as factor. 03:52 And I'm kind of segmenting each company out by location, pricing, meal options, and timing. And this I think is just really helpful for the viewers of this case study to better understand What is really going on here, where do these companies deliver to, how much does it actually cost per meal, what 04:14 types of options do they have, what's the timing? Timing is a really big part of this because UberEats as you may know is really focused on real-time delivery, so 30 minutes later you get your food, whereas these companies are focused on delivering meals many days later after you've actually ordered 04:34 them because they have to prepare them in bulk. So I wanted to set the stage of what these companies actually look like today in kind of a comparing contrast between them and Uber Eats. 04:48 Now this section is the audience. So here it's really important that we're identifying different aspects of the user base for these two kind of groups of people. 05:01 So I kind of point out that there are a lot of similarities between UberEats users and users who ordered packaged meals like freshly. 05:09 So the three that I wanted to focus on here were age attitudes and personas. Age 54% are millennial or genx for UberEats and for packaged meal users 64% are millennial or genx. 05:24 In terms of attitudes, 60% of UberEats users order delivery to avoid shopping and preparing meals, and 65% of packaged meal users seek quick and easy meal solutions. 05:37 So these two attitudes, and I found these in different sources, are very, very similar to each other, and then personas are pretty much all the same except businesses and teams. 05:49 Businesses and teams and companies may order Uber Eats for their employees in bulk, and that doesn't really happen with packaged meal users. 05:58 But in general, whether you're a busy professional, parents, elderly college students, travelers, this may be a really good option for you, whether it's ordering Uber Eats or ordering these packaged meals. 06:12 These types of people may not exactly be cooking all the time. So, I wanted to demonstrate here that there are a lot of similarities between existing Uber Eats users and packaged meal users so that from the case study viewer's perspective, offering a packaged meal solution would make sense, it would 06:32 fit the needs of this user group. Now, in this section, I go through some insights. What are the pain points that these users need addressed? 06:43 And I have a couple of sources down here. It's really great when you can to include sources. You don't have to, as you'll see in the PayPal case study. 06:52 I kind of viewed it. I kind of did the user insights and pain point section just from a lens of evaluating their current app. 07:02 But for UberEats specifically, one of the main ones is that users seek cost effective meal options, and this is in general. 07:10 So people look for food options that won't break the bank, especially in 2022. And then I point out that like if a user is in New York and wanted to order six meals for the week, it can cost them up to $135 including TIFF. 07:26 And that's around $20 per meal. Versus packaged meal services like freshly, might cost an average of $13 after shipping. And that's an average of $7 savings per meal. 07:39 So I'm basically pointing out that like users are seeking these cost-effective meal options But right now Uber Eats isn't actually satisfying it because the price is very high Second is that users are searching for healthy meal options I point out that over time more and more people are trying to eat 07:58 healthy 80% plus of users don't feel like they eat healthier when they get food delivered compared to when they cook so So we know from this that users are seeking healthy food options but UberEats isn't actually supplying them with that right now, 80% of the time they don't feel like they're eating 08:16 healthy but on contrasting that point, 81% of people believe meal kits are healthier than prepared food from grocery stores. So what I'm trying to do here is pointing out these pain points that exist for the existing Uber Eats population and demonstrating that packaged meals really solve the problems 08:38 for them. And then the last is that users want more convenience. Millennials exhibit a strong preference for convenience, spending the least amount of time preparing food compared to other generations. 08:49 66% of millennials reported buying prepared food within seven days prior. So this is demonstrating that for our target market right here, which is the same across Uber Eats packaged meals. 09:01 These users really don't want to be spending time in the kitchen. And we know that if they were to cook, they would spend a lot of time. 09:09 So I point out that a batch of packaged meals typically only takes two to three minutes to heat up and can last five to seven days in the refrigerator. 09:19 So this packaged meal solution is extremely convenient for this user base and it addresses a lot of their pain points. 09:28 Now, I go through a user journey here. This is a kind of different user journey than what I go through in PayPal, which I'll show you. 09:36 But I want to demonstrate how the user groups order food across these two solutions to show that there's a lot of similarities. 09:44 So UberEats users and package meal users are opening the app or platform. In the case of Uber, they're selecting whether or not they want to deliver, pick up or dine in, they're browsing and selecting a restaurant, adding menus, menu items to the cart, submitting the order, and then they receive the 10:03 order about 30 to 35 minutes later. Now on the flip side, package meal users are going through a kind of similar process where they're selecting a number of meals, the delivery date, they're adding the meals to the cart, they're submitting the order, and then they receive the order. 10:18 The only big difference is that they receive it two to five days later. So, I'm kind of pointing that out here that in general, the user journeys of these two user groups are similar, it's just the end portion, the fulfillment aspect that is different. 10:35 So another big area that I wanted to focus on for Uber is the fact that they're a marketplace. So they have these different user groups that could be affected by a new addition to the marketplace. 10:50 And so I wanted to highlight different advantages versus risks and disadvantages with each one of those. Because Uber would never want to kind of create a new product experience that ruins the experience for delivery careers because without delivery careers the whole Uber Eats ecosystem fails. 11:10 Similarly, if we create a solution that upsets restaurants and grocery stores and they go off the platform that would ruin the ecosystem. 11:21 So I wanted to evaluate advantages disadvantages for each one of these and when a possible note a source and link out to a source there. 11:32 So I won't go into detail on each of these but I wanted to make that clear and kind of how you can take this and use it for another product is if you're working on a products like think about the company as a whole like that's part of the product manager's job is to think really at a high level about 11:52 how their product or feature initiative is going to impact the company as a whole and the experience for all the users and so you want to consider evaluating like if we make this change how will it impact XYZ type of user or an internal team etc. 12:13 Now this section is the big takeaways. So I like to make this kind of a dark background, have this wavy text here to really highlight this, that this is kind of the summary of what I found during the discovery phase. 12:28 So I point out that UberEats users are very similar to package meal delivery users. They're similar in age and share the same attitude when it comes to eating food. 12:38 They're used to similar ordering flows and the heat and eat market is projected to continue expanding at a high rate. 12:47 Also there are plenty of advantages for packaged meal companies to partner with UberEats. So I do a two long dot read UberEats users and packaged meal user companies can benefit from a new packaged meal offering on UberEats. 13:02 Now from there I want to lay out a goal. So the goal here that I chose is increasing the average orders per user per week by introducing packaged meals into the Uber Eats experience. 13:14 I think if we can give them the Uber Eats users a more cost-effective way to eat and get meals delivered that it'll increase the amount of time that they're actually ordering. 13:28 So next I'm moving to feature prioritization and MVP definition, what actually should be included in the MVP. So in this section, I want to highlight different user stories in the format of as a blank user, I want to do blank so that I can blank. 13:47 As an UberEats user, I want to explore packaged meal partners so that I can decide which one to order with. 13:53 And then here I go into more detail. So because this is a completely new meal type, they will be offered within UberEats, users to eat an extremely easy and visible way to explore package meal partners like freshly to learn about the offering. 14:07 I won't go through all of these, but basically I'm giving the viewer a good look into the acceptance criteria for this solution. 14:16 So I address as an Uber Eats user for these top three and it kind of takes you through the ordering journey. 14:24 So you find package meal partners, you You select a brand, the meals you want in a delivery date, and then you can see the status of your order. 14:33 Now down here, I focus on the Packaged Meal Company. So this is from the lens of Freshly, for example. So they can sync meal types, availability, and schedules with Uber Eats. 14:44 They can ingest new orders so that they can fulfill those orders. And then down here, I do as an Uber Eats delivery career. 14:52 I have all the information and supplies necessary to deliver Packaged Meals. So as you notice up here, I'm going through kind of a user stories for each one of these user groups, except restaurants and grocery, because they wouldn't be involved in this ordering process in addition to a regular Uber Eats 15:10 user. So in this section, I go into solutions explorer. So what options do we actually have to offer and fulfill these package meals on Uber Eats? 15:20 So I won't go into great detail here. but I highlight that we can go the schedule route or an on-demand route. 15:28 And I make it really easy to understand here. Users can schedule a batch of package meals to be delivered a few days in the future. 15:34 Versus on-demand, which is users can order package meals for delivery within 30 minutes. And I'm basically just outlining if we were to go with this solution, the order types that a user could have, are there a batch subscription where they're subscribing having to say eight meals a week or a batch single 15:55 order, where for one week they've selected eight orders, eight meals. And then I'm going into detail with fulfillment, because fulfillment is a really big part of the Uber kind of strategy. 16:08 They're really good at fulfilling. So I wanted to highlight what it would look like to actually fulfill these meals. Now, on demand in contract, in contrast, is that users can order packaged meals for delivery within 30 minutes and again I go into detail with fulfillment here and I wanted to highlight 16:27 these two different options because they create a vastly different user experience and there's kind of benefits and you know there's negative aspects and there's positive aspects to both so then in the next section I wanted to evaluate these solutions and what I did here is kind of this chart where on 16:50 the left side here, I had different vectors to kind of score these different solutions after. And then horizontally here, I have schedule, that subscription, that single order, versus on demand, single batch and add on. 17:06 As you see up here, those map to the order types and fulfillment options. So I'm basically highlighting that like this is an option, this is an option, this is an option, this is an option. 17:17 and I wanted to evaluate which option out of all these is the best one for us to launch with. And I highlight here that a batch subscription that's fulfilled by Uber has the highest business impact user experience and benefits for the delivery careers. 17:34 So we can see that here where visually it's easy to see this has the most green and has no red. 17:41 So I'm basically, this is an exercise that I went through myself to say, okay, Okay, if we allow UberEats users to schedule a batch of meals to be ordered and they get it every week, that's going to have a really great business impact because we're creating reoccurring revenue for the business. 18:04 The user experience is also going to be great because people can just go on their UberEats app. It's going to be a seamless user experience and they will benefit from not having to go on to those other websites, like Freshly, that may not be the best experiences. 18:22 Career financial impact. Now, I won't go through each one of these, but I wanted to highlight each one for each solution type and grade it between red, yellow, and green. 18:36 Okay, so now is where I display the final solution here. So packaged meal subscriptions by UberEats. I highlight, and these are all mapped to the original pain points, that this product is cost effective. 18:51 We're saving money by using Uber's delivery network to fulfill the package meals. We're focused on healthy options. So a lot of the package meal subscriptions that you saw at the top of the page had a bunch of different healthy options, whether vegetarian, vegan, low calorie, gluten-free, dairy-free, 19:10 plant-based, et cetera, there's going to be a lot of healthy options for the users. Going back down handed to you, so schedule a delivery time when you know you'll be home ensuring your food's food stays safe. 19:23 So we're creating a unique value proposition of using UberEats to order packaged meals as opposed to ordering directly with the company and then sustainable ordering. 19:33 UberEats careers keep the gel ice packs to reuse in future orders. This is another great benefit when we use the Uber delivery or fulfillment network as opposed to UPS or FedEx, for example. 19:45 Then, from there, I go into what would the user experience look like? So, I created these high-fidelity mockups of, if we were to implement this, what would it ultimately look like in the user interface? 19:57 So, and then I wanted to highlight the benefits. So, the first is being separate from restaurants. This ties back to one of the disadvantages I pointed out above is that package meal orders may cannibalize total orders from restaurant and grocery stores. 20:15 And that's obviously a big concern for Uber and the restaurants. So I wanted to make sure that users had a clear way place to go for different types of meals. 20:28 So we You can introduce this new kind of packaged meals button up top. And then I also want the experience to be transparent, simple and educational. 20:38 This is a new ordering concept to users and we want to guide them through the ordering experience. So when someone taps packaged meals, we see this nice subheader here. 20:50 Enjoy chef-prepared meals delivered to your doorstep every week. Heat up in two to three minutes and keep in your refrigerator up to seven days. 20:57 So it's really summarizing the heat and meat heat and eat kind of market into these two quick lines And then users can explore the different brands that are available on UberEats And then I give some quick information down here Which is really similar to the kind of label here for regular For regular 21:19 Meals I do the same for these package meals now going down below So again, we want to message the benefits. 21:26 So throughout the funnel, we'll want to message the benefits of subscribing to a package meal plan on UberEats. For example, these two benefits right here are picking a time that works with your schedule. 21:37 And the fact that the career will recycle packaging materials for reuse. Now I demonstrate what the time selection could look like. 21:48 And in all of this, I'm using components that UberEats has already built out. For example, this view right here is already what it looks like if you were to order from your regular restaurant. 22:01 I did update the buttons here though. View cart, three of four meals selected. That's going to be a little bit different of a button than a regular restaurant order. 22:11 So I point this out that we'll use common components and patterns for this ordering experience. In this section, I go through what a launch and go-to-market strategy would look like. 22:23 So here I'm going and demonstrating visually a kind of phased approach to actually rolling this out. So, the first one is that we run a pilot in a single city in the United States, and I kind of highlight that we want to ensure the marketplace remains healthy and balanced. 22:40 Then we'd iterate based on our learnings, and then we would expand to more markets in you know, in states, and eventually roll out globally. 22:47 So I won't go through each one of these, but it's really showing a structured and kind of scientific way to roll this out to a large user-based single city pilots are really common for Uber Eats actually and Uber in general. 23:04 And I found this out when I was doing research. So I wanted to propose a similar rollout strategy for this case study. 23:11 And then logistics is a huge part of kind of rolling out different features within the Uber Eats ecosystem and Uber platform in general. 23:21 And so I highlighted the different teams that would be involved, just that I'm showing the viewer of this case study that I'm thinking comprehensively about what would it actually take to get this out there to users. 23:33 Education is also a big one. So when you're at a big company like Uber Eats, you want to think about okay if we're introducing this new kind of concept or new feature into the product, who do we actually have to tell and educate? 23:47 So that's internal stakeholders like support, marketing, data science, etc. and external stakeholders. The careers are a huge one. Packaged meal brands are huge as well and they need to understand the nuances of this new offering. 24:03 Now in terms of measuring success, so we want to be very clear about what is the metric that we're looking to move with this new product. 24:12 So for this one, I chose the North Star metric of average orders per user per week. So I say if we're successful, we should see this metric increase because UberEats users are ordering more meals throughout the week. 24:26 So I'm really highlighting that this, and it ties back to the goal above, is how we will know whether or not our solution is successful. 24:36 And this would happen in the pilot phase. We'll be looking at, okay, how does the average order number per user per week metric change once we introduce this new order type? 24:50 I have a couple leading indicators and lagging indicators here. So package meal brand impressions. This is kind of top of the funnel, who's actually clicking and viewing the freshly and cook unity cards. 25:03 What is the conversion rate? So, you know, how many users are actually checking out and ordering these meals? Now, if we go to lagging indicators, one could be average revenue per user per month. 25:15 So, this is a, again, like this looks back at success, so, and that's why it's a lagging indicator. So, our poo per month is in a tell us like, okay, now that we actually introduced this new way to order food, did we increase the amount of revenue we're earning per user per month. 25:36 Similarly, are we retaining users more? That was the original hypothesis I mentioned at the top. Now that we introduce this new type of meal, our more and more users are staying on the Uber Eats platform and using it more frequently. 25:55 Now, counter metrics and monitoring metrics. These counter metrics again are different things that could go wrong with our launch. So one of the ones I pointed out a couple times was the restaurant, you know, partners of that Uber has, if their orders go down per week and then they go off the platform 26:15 , that would be very detrimental to the Uber Eats ecosystem because Uber Eats relies on the restaurants to generate a large portion of the revenue. 26:25 So if they see orders is going down, and then they decide, you know what, I'm just going to stick to DoorDash. 26:31 That could be a very, very bad kind of decision for Uber, UberEats. Monitoring metrics, these are different things where we'd want to have alerts on the engineering team so that if these different metrics are kind of acting up, we'd be able to be notified and fix the issue. 26:51 So package meal subscription start error read. So, you know, when someone wants to go and actually create a subscription for meals, how often is the app just saying, you know, we're having an issue loading this right now. 27:06 We got that to happen very, very infrequently. So, I go through a couple different monitoring metrics here to quickly identify if we need to fix a core part of the flow. 27:16 Now, in the final thoughts section, I kind of provide the viewer with a summary of kind of where we started with the primary objective and rehashing the original hypothesis, giving a kind of succinct overview of the current state of things and the proposal by leveraging existing infrastructure, UberEats 27:39 can create a differentiated seamless experience that adds value to users. And then I say, as a product manager at Uber, I would recommend conducting a small-scale pilot test in a specific market to evaluate the impact of introducing package meals on the identified north star metric average orders per 27:56 user per week. So really getting into the viewers kind of minds that I could be a product manager at Uber and this is all evidence that I would do of what I would do if I actually were a PM there. 28:10 Then I added this fun little sentence at the end just to add some personality in the final thought section and thanking the reader or sorry the viewer for reading through this whole case study. 28:22 So all in all, that is the Uber Eats case study that I did. You know I again at each portfolio and case study page doesn't have to exactly match you know the guidelines that I'm putting out in all these videos but as as frequently as you can stick to what I've laid out the better means it really adds 28:46 a lot of structure to these case studies to these pages and that'll make it much easier for the viewers to actually understand what's going on and the points that you're trying to make. 28:58 But with that being said, if something doesn't fit exactly or you want to do something different like the marketplace here, feel free to add that in if it makes sense in the context of the product or problem you're solving. 29:09 So with that being said, I will see you in in the next lesson.","Learn how to structure a product case study for UberEats packaged meal delivery so you can justify an MVP, rollout plan, and success metrics.",e8139186-7449-4d9f-9811-c21e61bee066,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Case Example: Uber Eats,15,TRUE,30,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:56.920289+00
a9efd91fdd25478f99a1becde7060275,"00:00 And this lesson, I'm going to go over a PayPal case study. So, and this one, it's adding Universal Search to the PayPal app. 00:07 So, again, this is another case study I actually did for PayPal in the job application process, and I wanted to put it on the site so that other hiring managers could see the work that I put into it. 00:18 So, the goal here is the contact section is to kind of set the stage. So, we're saying that the goal of the initiative is to add universal search to the PayPal mobile app. 00:29 We want to make it easy and fast for PayPal users to find what they need. In the case, study, I'll be evaluating the PayPal ecosystem and user base to determine common pain points PayPal users have. 00:40 And from there, I'll define an MVP solution that addresses those core pain points. Finally, I'll set success. So I'm basically going in detail in this section here, setting the stage of what are we doing here, and what are the exact steps I'm going to take to get to the final solution. 00:57 And then I point out that this is the existing home screen. So this is a kind of graphic that I made. 01:03 So going in here to the hypothesis, if PayPal adds universal search to their mobile app, then users will be able to complete core actions faster. 01:13 And this hypothesis was based off of the fact that there's a lot that users can clearly do in the app. 01:20 But there isn't really an easy single way to get to all of those actions. Like, you have to know what tabs to tap into. 01:27 You have some contacts here, but not all of them. So this is the goal, or kind of the hypothesis that I set out. 01:37 So looking into the market, right? Here we have Venmo, and I kind of went into this in the other lessons, but we, I want to point out like, what could we learn from competitors? 01:47 So I looked at Venmo, Instagram, and SeekGeek, three native apps because we're focused solely on the native app experience for PayPal. 01:57 I also want to point out that I blurred out some information from these screenshots just to protect the privacy of people that are in my Venmo network or on the screen here. 02:08 So I say that in the case of Venmo users can search people, businesses, and charities, trying to start to instill into the kind of viewer that it's very common for a search bar to be searching multiple entities or multiple types of things. 02:25 Now, when we look at Instagram, I say that it falls a similar pattern. Users can search anything and Instagram will return appropriate results. 02:33 Also, Instagram prompts users with these fun kind of prompts here and I took a screen recording and turned this into a GIF so that viewers could see this. 02:44 And then I'm demonstrating here that when they actually do search, there's these tabs where users can filter down the results to be what they want. 02:53 But Instagram is selecting the top options here based on what they believe is most applicable to what you're searching for. 03:03 Now in the case of eBay, LinkedIn, and Google, again, these are very indirect kind of competitors. They have search experiences all within them, but they're definitely not competing with PayPal, and in some cases they're integrated with PayPal, like eBay is integrated with PayPal, Venmo is owned by PayPal 03:23 . So all that to say is that I'm kind of highlighting a couple themes across all the apps. Like the fact that search on each one of these is always on the home tab or the first tab. 03:35 It really grounds the user and sets the stage so that they can find whatever they need from it. Also, I point out that in all these cases, you know, the apps are saying search for anything or search. 03:48 In the case of LinkedIn, you can search for multiple things here. You can search for topics, you can search for people, companies, Google, obviously, you can search for anything. 03:58 So these companies have probably tested that word and have found that search is the one that performs the best. And again, going back to the fact that search experiences support many different categories of results. 04:15 So then I dove into the audience. So who uses PayPal? Now I wanted to attach a source to all these different areas here. 04:24 I focused on age, kind of what behaviors they have. So I'm saying here that 24% of PayPal's United States user base are 58 years old or older. 04:35 This is about 48 million users, just pretty significant. I'm pointing out that they transact a good amount throughout the year, a couple times a month at least. 04:46 And PayPal is in a lot of countries and a lot of currencies are supported. But the United States has the most users. 04:53 I wanted to highlight also that PayPal, as a company, does have two user groups, individuals and merchants. And I wanted to say that we're focusing specifically that on individuals here. 05:05 PayPal has a PayPal business app as well, and so I just wanted to point that out. This also demonstrates to the viewer that I'm really thinking holistically about the PayPal ecosystem. 05:17 Now, use cases of PayPal. I just wanted to document what are all the things that a PayPal user can actually do? 05:24 Okay, they can pay online with purchase protection. They can link multiple payment methods. They can donate to a charity. There's a bunch of different things here. 05:34 But I point out here that without explicit usage data, so this is an assumption that I'm making, and I'm calling that out specifically. 05:43 And in case studies, you a lot of the time have to do that. You have to make some assumptions, because you're not actually a product manager at the company yet, so you don't have all the data. 05:52 But I say that we can basically assume, based on the prominence that these two buttons have in the user interface, is that sending and requesting investing money is a really critical, highly used case for individuals and then also managing transactions with individuals and merchants as we can see with 06:12 these contacts here. So then I go into really outlining the fact that I'm going to focus really in on solving this problem for users where they live in the United States, they're over the age of 58 and they do these three kind of core actions. 06:31 So I go into more detail here basically to say that our ultimate universal search solution is gonna provide value for all users but we wanna solve core paid points for this user segment first. 06:46 And then I go into why. And it basically is outlining the fact that people over a certain age have much more difficult time adopting technology. 06:56 and because this elderly or older segment of users is so common amongst PayPal within the user base, I wanted to make sure that the solution worked well for them and then expanding it out to additional demographic kind of segments, those segments would be able to adopt universal search easier. 07:18 So I kind of go into explaining that here a little bit. So then I go into user insights And these I don't have sources on, and I think that's generally fine. 07:28 I'm basically pointing out different aspects of the app experience that are difficult. So these are kind of facts. So hard time finding a contact request money from or send it money to. 07:44 One friction point here is that the person may not be a PayPal user yet, so they may not even be in a system. 07:48 them. The person may only be searchable in PayPal's database by contact info the user doesn't have. So for example, they could be in PayPal with their email, but the user may only have the phone number. 08:01 The name may be different on PayPal. So this is just outlining a couple different reasons why a user may have a hard time finding a contact. 08:10 The next is hard time sifting through a lot of transactions. I basically point out that But there may be old transactions that a user wants to get to, but they're buried under this wallet and activity tab. 08:24 And users may want to find transactions by a different criteria, other than just kind of sorting by date. The next is that it takes a long time to see all the past history with a specific individual or merchant. 08:37 So I went through the app and actually tried to do this myself, and it took four to five clicks to get to. 08:41 And the users may not also exactly know how to get there. This was after actually a lot of trial and error. 08:49 So I won't go into all these, but I'm basically pointing out different pain points and areas and supporting facts or evidence for those pieces and pain points. 09:01 Now, in this section, I outline the user journey. And I really love this section. It's a fun visual. and I'll give access to this and show you how to do it in the figment training, but basically we're outlining the user journey that someone may have within our target demographic and within the confines 09:23 of the use cases that I mentioned above. So this is Natalie, she's 64, and the scenario to set the stage is that she sends money to her daughter Amy every couple of weeks through PayPal. 09:34 and Natalie's husband asked her how much she sent a couple months ago, so Natalie's going, I like to put out some expectations here, she's going into the app, thinking I can easily find this transaction, I can easily just find Amy and see my history, should take a couple seconds. 09:52 So then we go and break that those expectations basically with this user journey chart. So one Natalie opens PayPal. Where is Amy's contact she made thing? 10:04 Natalie decides to click on the Payments tab. Looking for money, I said, so maybe I should tap on Payments. Natalie sees Amy's contacts and taps it. 10:14 Natalie lands on a send payment to Amy's screen. This isn't what I wanted. So she taps to go back. Well, if it's not in Payments, where could it be? 10:23 She then taps through every single tab. Finances, deals, finally wallet. She's thinking at this point, I can't believe it's so hard to find Amy. 10:32 Then she sees activity and taps on it and says, this might be it. And she starts scrolling through all the transactions to go back a couple months. 10:40 And she's thinking to herself, I wish I could just see all my history with Amy. And that only finds the transaction and tells her husband. 10:47 And her final thought is that was annoying. I hope I don't have to do that any time, again, any time soon. 10:52 So, I'm taking, you know, the viewer of this case study through the journey that a user may take if they're trying to complete one of those core actions that I mentioned above. 11:05 Now in this section, I go to the big takeaways. So, I say that we conclude a couple of things. One, PayPal is growing in popularity amongst an older demographic as a way to send and receive money. 11:19 Two, it's really common for native apps to have universal search. On the home screen to enable users to quickly get to where they want to go. 11:28 And right now these core use cases like finding a contact or transaction are very difficult and time-consuming to complete, as really clearly outlined here. 11:38 So the problem, PayPal is lacking an easy way to enable their target user to find what they need to find and complete core actions. 11:47 So here I'm outlining the goal. We want to decrease the time it takes to complete core actions on the PayPal app by empowering users to search through all the content and features available to them from one search box. 12:00 So I use this kind of mechanism to highlight this because I want to really convey to the user that this is the viewer that this is the most important thing that we're doing. 12:11 I go into additional detail here. So, then I go into a feature prioritization and MVP definition section. So, I am kind of scoping down the solution to say that we are going to focus on an empty state and the result state because these are the fewest required to provide users with context and value and 12:34 allow us to begin learning if universal search is really solving pain points for the users. So, this goes back to the training on this part of the case study around MVPs. 12:45 We really only want to build a solution that is the least amount of work necessary to start providing value to users so we can learn from them about how they're actually making use of the feature and functionality. 13:04 So in this section, I represent a couple of user stories, so as a PayPal user, I can search for things from my home screen. 13:12 And then I point out, we'll add a universal search bar on the home screen, tapping on it will open search autocomplete view with the keyboard. 13:20 As a PayPal user on the search screen, I have quick access to my top items. So I'm pointing out that users are going to see individual contacts, see a prompt request permission to access local phone contacts to help with this, they'll see merchants, etc. 13:36 And in this little description here, I point out that if we were to create a universal search solution that encompasses all content across the entire PayPal, it would be a huge undertaking. 13:49 So I point out that we want to start by testing an MVP. And if successful, we will kind of expand out to help users find additional items in the app. 14:01 So then I outlined the final solution. As you saw in the Uber Eats case study, I went through kind of exploring and evaluating different solutions. 14:11 In this case, I wanted to jump straight to a final solution because there weren't many different ways that the Universal Search could be implemented. 14:22 So I wanted to keep it focused on what I viewed the final result to be. So, again, a lot of this stuff is pointing back to the user research and competitive research that we did at the beginning, so we're saying search PayPal. 14:36 And I made these nice high-fidelity mockups really so that it looks clean and looks professional and I even found the PayPal font and downloaded that font specifically so that I would match their look and style. 14:50 In the empty state, sorry, we're seeing a couple different sections or categories, and this provides users with context into what they can actually search for with this MVP. 15:05 Now if we go down, I demonstrate that these results are a mix of different categories based on the search term. 15:13 Each kind of result has a similar design element so that the user can quickly identify which you know each result is and so an example here is that next to here we have a person icon as opposed to a m which PayPal currently has which isn't really super helpful versus anthropology has a you know this 15:37 is clearly a company with a logo and then I just point out that as the user continues to type result will dynamically adjust to best fit the search term so once we started typing O-N, Anthropology didn't make much sense, and we then removed Anthropology from the list. 15:57 Now in this section, I point out some risks and trade-offs associated with introducing Universal Search to the app, because PayPal is an enormous company and organization, and so small little changes to their app could really dramatically impact the bottom line. 16:15 So I wanted to go in detail into what risks we're, you know, opening ourselves up to if we add search to the app and this conveys really to the viewer of this case study that you are a product manager that really takes a step back and looks holistically at how your work impacts the broader organization 16:37 . So, you know, one example here, getting permission to access local phone contacts. I point out that this may have previously been solved in other areas of the app, but we want to still be cognizant of these risks for our universal search solution as well. 16:52 So there's a user privacy concern about syncing users contactless and associated data, resulting in users not giving permission. and there may be technical challenges associated with combining the local phone contact information with PayPal's contact database all while returning results fast. 17:11 And we need to make sure that there's a way that results are de-duped or there aren't duplicate results that are returning in the search results which could really confuse users. 17:23 So I go just kind of into great detail about some concerns I have about this. In practice, these are concerns that would be brought up by the team, and we brainstorm ways to solve them, both with engineers and designers. 17:38 Next section is measuring success. So I point out the main North Star metric here is this funnel of app open to core use case completion rate. 17:49 So how many users open the app, and then how many users is actually complete a core use case. So those core use cases are sending money, requesting money, or viewing a past transaction. 18:03 And so this will basically measure when we do an AB test where 50% of users will see the old version and 50% will see the version with the search bar. 18:14 What is the difference in the number of users who actually open the app and then complete one of these core actions? 18:20 If our hypothesis is right, that we're providing a much easier way for users to complete these actions, then we should see that this rate increases. 18:35 We also look at secondary metrics here. I went into this in the lesson, so I won't go in super detail. 18:41 But we are going and drilling down pretty specifically into the metrics that I as a product manager would look at. 18:48 For example, search start to result click rate. So how many users begin searching and then select a result? And this is differ by user type, or sorry, result type. 18:59 So maybe we're not doing a great job at helping users find transactions, but we are with contacts. So I'd wanna look at what this actually looks like from beginning to end. 19:10 Another one here is number of weekly active users using search. So hopefully we see that more and more users are adopting search over time, and this would signal that it's providing value to them and they're consistently going back to it over time. 19:24 Down at the bottom I have a couple of counter metrics, so decreased new user account completion rate. So when you actually download the PayPal app for the first time, there's going to be a set of account setup steps that they're pushing users to to complete, and if we have a search bar right at the top 19:43 of the screen, this may push down on those steps. So this could be an unintended negative side effect or a consequence of us introducing this. 19:51 So I want to call those out specifically here. And then finally, I go into the launch and go to market strategy. 19:58 So I'm very clearly calling out that we want to AB test this universal search solution. I show what it looks like here again. 20:06 And basically say that we want to ensure that we're actually improving the PayPal app user's experience here. So, I highlight the versions in this AB test, so Control-A variant B. 20:21 The control is the current PayPal app without Universal Search, and I'm saying we'd start at 90% of the audience in this bucket, because PayPal, again, is an enormous app. 20:33 They have hundreds of millions of users, so we don't want to introduce something if we're not super confident in it yet. 20:39 But next is the audience. So users who live in the United States are over the age of 58. These are the users we identified at the beginning that we want to focus on. 20:49 And we're looking at this primary metric of the average time between app open and core use case completion. And going into some more detail here, basically saying that depending on what happens with the AB test, we'll go in a certain direction. 21:06 So, if the AB test results are positive, we will expand our test cohort to all users in the United States regardless of age. 21:14 And then I say, no, if our AB tests are negative, we'll investigate potential causes, iterate and rerun the experiment. So, I'm outlining exactly how we will launch this, test it, and what will happen depending on the results. 21:28 In this section, I go through future iterations. So, this section is really demonstrating that I have a future facing look on things. 21:36 I can be creative and actually think about how does this feature expand over time? So, again, I include some high fidelity mockups here that basically say that another way to make it even faster for PayPal users to complete core actions is to just put those core actions right in the result itself. 21:56 So when they see a result, instead of tapping on this result in going to another screen, we can animate this open and just have send or request buttons right there. 22:07 Additionally, I'm pointing out all the different additional things that they'd be able to search in the universal search that aren't supported for the MVP like invoices, charities, etc. 22:18 And then the final thoughts section. So I kind of do a little recap here. I say that I recommend maybe testing the MVP of Universal Search with a goal of decreasing the amount of time it takes to complete core actions. 22:34 And I then rehash exactly what we would do if the results of the test are positive. And then I think the viewer for checking out the case study. 22:43 So all in all, that is the PayPal case study. As I mentioned in the Uber Eats case study, as well, it doesn't exactly have to be what I presented in the guidelines, but it is best practice to include as many sections and as many details as you can as possible. 23:01 And yeah, if you have any questions, let me know, either in Slack or over email. Thank you.","Learn how to structure a PayPal universal search case study from hypothesis to MVP, metrics, and A/B test plan so you can propose and validate faster core actions.",a7d8b7eb-f988-4630-8410-76954137976b,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Case Example: PayPal,16,TRUE,24,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:57.528269+00
3a66b5086da747bfaf2f65601f8a3da4,"0:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over the parts of a case study. Case study is one of the most important things for your product portfolio and I'm going to quickly give an overview of the different sections and then in later lessons I'll deep dive into each component of the case study. 0:17 So there are four main parts of the product development process and therefore the product case study. So this is what the double diamond product development process looks like. 0:29 There's kind of these two overarching parts of it. There's the problem over here and then there's the solution. So the idea is that you start with some type of challenge or insight and you diverge to really understand like what is actually happening here? 0:47 Like this is the time to look at competitors, look, listen to users and what they're saying and really just understand the problem and then you converge down and you really define what is the true core problem that our users are experiencing here, based on all the information we were able to gather 1:08 during this exploration phase. Then once you have a clear definition of the problem that you're trying to solve, then you diverge again and actually investigate different ways that you can develop solutions. 1:23 How can you solve this problem? What is the way that's going to be most effective? And then after testing it and learning more, you converge again and you end up with your final solution that is supposed to provide the most value for your users. 1:40 Now, within each of these sections, as you learn more, you kind of go in a loop. So, you might learn something that changes your idea of the problem and you might start to investigate other areas. 1:53 Similarly, for the solution area, you might start to test different prototypes or solutions and learn stuff about how users are interacting with it and go back to the drawing board and kind of iterate over and over. 2:08 So again, these four parts are what will actually be showing and working on in the case studies within your product portfolio. 2:18 So to give a little bit more detail here, the Discover F*** really involves researching the market, identifying problems in that market, and gathering information about the customers and their needs. 2:31 Next in Define, this is part two, in this stage the information you gathered in the Discover stage is actually used to further define the problem and state a clear goal for solving that problem. 2:45 And then in Develop, the third stage, the product is actually designed, developed and tested. It includes iterating on the product based on feedback from the user testing itself. 2:57 So this again is that loop of exploring solutions and actually trying to find the best one. And then deliver is the final stage where the final product is defined and prepared for launch. 3:10 There's really a focus on ensuring successful adoption of the feature with a go-to-market plan and identifying improvements based on user feedback. 3:20 So you want to make sure there are ways to measure success for your feature solution. So these are the four parts in future lessons I'm going to deep dive into each one of these to help you actually run a case study for yourself.",Learn how to structure a product portfolio case study using the double diamond stages so you can document your process from problem discovery to launch-ready delivery.,0f9db672-9baf-4c71-b1ca-c23b4c58014f,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Parts of a Case Study,2,TRUE,4,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:57.996175+00
f43562bfd8074fd1948978d38cb41c4a,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over picking a product and problem to actually work on, with your case study. 00:07 So, which product or problem should you actually pick in the portfolio? You want to pick a product or problem that really aligns with the goals of building your product portfolio in the first place. 00:19 The first is that you want the product or problem to demonstrate that you have a diverse skill set. You want to work on something that you're passionate about and you want to work on products that you know have existing problems Finally, you want to work on products that relate to the companies You'll 00:35 actually be applying to so that when a hiring manager visits your portfolio and checks out one of the case studies They have that light bulb moment where they see the future of you working at their company So to dive deep into each one of these the first is Again, that you want to demonstrate you have 00:54 a really diverse skill set. You want to show that you can work in a wide array of features and types of products. 01:01 So some examples here, and this depends on what you really are looking for in your future career. The first is mobile apps. 01:09 So this is, you know, DoorDash, Hinge, Duolingo, Strava, Comm. These are really well respected, highly used, and successful mobile apps. 01:19 And developing for a mobile app is very different than developing for a website. You have a lot less screen real estate. 01:28 People are using their fingers a lot more to tap things, zoom in on things, et cetera. So mobile apps have a really different set of problems compared to websites. 01:40 Now websites, Airbnb, Amazon, LinkedIn, GoogleFlights, these are good examples of traditional website experiences that, again, have unique issues and problems. 01:52 There's a lot of screen real estate and you want to make sure your users aren't bouncing all over the screen trying to find the right information. 02:01 So with all of the screen real estate, what do you actually do with it? There's specific problems there. The next is desktop apps. 02:09 So Slack, Figma, Things3, Discord, Spotify. These are examples of native applications to your desktop computer or laptop that, again, have a different style that's really important that users can easily make use of the computer's keyboard for certain commands. 02:31 So commands are really interesting and integral to a desktop app experience. The pro users of Figma are frequently using the keyboard instead of their mouse because it saves a lot of time. 02:43 So, there are specific problems and challenges and opportunities that come with desktop apps. The fourth here is community. So, this is kind of a style of platform. 02:55 Next door is a good example, meetup or Reddit, where you're dealing with a large population of users who are interacting with each other. 03:04 There is privacy concerns here, there is monitoring concerns here to make sure that people are using the platform properly. So this is a distinct set of challenges that come with communities. 03:18 Third, sorry, the fifth is marketplaces. So this could be SeatGeek where they are, there are buyers and sellers of tickets, Uber Eats where there are restaurants who are selling food and consumers who are buying that food. 03:33 And you have a third entity in there which is the delivery careers. Facebook Marketplace is kind of a clear example. 03:41 There's people buying and selling physical items, mattresses, furniture, cars, et cetera. The second set here is the actual type of company. 03:53 So as I mentioned in previous lessons, it might be a B2B company where the business that the company is selling to other companies. 04:02 So a good example is Slack. Slack. Slack's main user group are companies to communicate amongst their employees. Zoom, HubSpot which is big into sales and marketing and customer service, AWS, Amazon Web Services. 04:20 This is the server infrastructure that Amazon offers to companies and only businesses are really kind of engaging with this product, but it's definitely a product that has a lot of engineers and product managers working for it. 04:36 B2C. So this is when the main customer is an end consumer, a regular person. Airbnb is a great example, Netflix, where all the users of Netflix are just regular people who want to watch TV shows and movies, Uber, Spotify, Peloton. 04:55 These are all individual kind of consumer users of these products and so it's very different to sell and create experiences for this type of user. 05:06 B2B to see is where a company is kind of doing both things here so they're creating solutions for businesses and also consumers and they're all kind of working together to create the overall business. 05:20 Square is a good example so if you ever go into a coffee shop and they swivel around the tablet and you pay, it asks you to add tip to your coffee order. 05:31 That's probably a square tablet. And so in that example in the coffee shop, it's a great way to demonstrate B2B2C where square is supplying software to the business, the coffee shop, and also creating user experiences for the end consumer there to actually pay and add tip. 05:51 Shopify is another good example where they're creating platforms and ways for people to sell products and then also for consumers to buy those products. 06:03 Seeky is a good example because they do ticketing for major sports teams in the United States and internationally. So they're working directly with those businesses but they also have a huge consumer fan base who just buys tickets to concerts. 06:20 Stripe, DocuSign, another good example of B2B to see companies. The next is you want to work on something that you are really passionate about. 06:31 The first reason why is that you really don't want to get bored when you're working on these case studies. They are pretty in depth, so you want to do it on something you're actually interested in, and you want that work to publicly reflect your interests. 06:44 You are really going to attract what you put out into the world with this. So for example, if you do a case study on Stripe, which is a developer platform to process payments, you are attracting very technical backend B2B developer type companies and roles. 07:02 And that may be exactly what you want to do. Netflix, if you do a case study in Netflix, you're going to be attracting creative companies, companies, companies that are building entertainment solutions or subscription based solutions. 07:17 Airbnb, this company has an extremely high bar for design. They're very consumer centric and they have a marketplace. So there's different attributes to all the companies that you may choose and I'm basically trying to say that depending on the product that you choose, that will reflect what you're 07:37 are actually interested in and impact the role that you eventually end up in. So decide what your interests are and then search for companies and products that align to those interests. 07:48 And maybe ask yourself, is this a product that you or a loved one uses? Is it a problem that you are a loved one experiences? 07:56 And this will be particularly helpful to provide context to the viewer of your portfolio of why you actually chose this problem to work on. 08:05 The next is you want to work on products that you know have existing problems. So your goal with the product case is to solve a problem that the user or the company is having. 08:17 This is crucial in product management. You never want to be building features and designing things just for the sake of doing it. 08:24 You always want to be solving a problem that someone is having. So the first example here is if you're solving a problem for a user, the problem could to be Airbnb users finds the way that fees are displayed to be frustrating and misleading. 08:39 And the goal there could be to determine a better way to display those fees that convert more users. A company problem could be that Netflix is losing 10% of subscribers every month. 08:50 This is an enormous problem for Netflix. So the goal here, for this case study, would be to determine the root cause of this user turn and test a solution to retain subscribers. 09:01 This may mean that if someone goes to subscribe unsubscribe, Netflix is offering a discount to retain them for additional months. 09:11 And these problems should be real. We always want to make sure we're working as product managers on problems that do exist in the world. 09:19 So look at news articles. This is a major one and it really gives you up-to-date information on what may be happening with the company. 09:27 You can look at app store reviews or reviews online. Just to see like what are recent negative experiences that customers are having, they're pretty vocal about it a lot of the time. 09:39 So this could be super valuable and read it. Like there's a lot of raw honest commentary about anything and everything on Reddit. 09:47 And so that's a great way or place to look to find out problems that users may be having with a particular software or company. 09:56 Next, work on products that relate to the companies you'll be applying to. So I kind of touched on this before, but while the case study you publish won't determine exactly the company you end up working at, it may have an influence. 10:10 So you want to keep in mind that you do want to show a diverse skill set so that many company types would be interested in you. 10:17 You don't want to kind of pigeonhole yourself into a particular type of technology or a particular business model. But with that being said, if you do case studies about a particular industries, companies in that industry will view you more favorably. 10:31 So because of this, you should be thoughtful about the industries that you choose to do case studies for. So if you really, really want to work in the healthcare technology space, then it definitely makes sense for you to work on case studies that have to do with healthcare. 10:48 Because when you are sending your portfolio to potential hiring managers, and they check it out. It'll very, very clearly demonstrate your interest in joining that industry and their company.","Learn how to choose a case-study product problem that showcases diverse skills, matches your interests, has real user issues, and fits target employers so you can build a relevant portfolio.",62bb9cb7-6f3c-4a1c-8c57-2c4fe803f702,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Picking a Product / Problem,3,TRUE,11,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:58.45039+00
564471e164954969901597570a4cf2f4,"00:00 In this lesson, I'll be going over the first part of the case study, the problem discovery. So to go back to this graphic, we are focused on the first section here to discover within the problem first half of the product development process. 00:15 So the overview here is that, there's a couple goals and a couple sections within this area of the case study. 00:22 Three goals are one, identify and deeply understand the core problem that we're trying to address, with the case study. Two, you want to research the market and competitors, both indirect and direct. 00:36 And three, we want to gather as much information as possible about the potential customers here and their needs and pain points. 00:43 So there's five sections that these goals can map to. The first is providing context, second, eye hypothesis, third, an overview of the market, fourth, an overview of the audience, and finally five user insights. 00:57 So the first one here is context. This section kind of sets the stage for your case study. It really explains why you decided to focus on this problem specifically. 01:08 You know, a couple ideas here are that you or a loved one is a user of the product. You may experience this problem or you've observed a trend in the market and identified a gap here. 01:19 The context section should be like four to six sentences long, maybe across one to two paragraphs. This doesn't have to this isn't a strict kind of rule, but in general it's good to keep it concise, but powerful. 01:31 You really want to hook the viewer of your case study they should want to read more, and your problem should be interesting enough for anyone to want to keep on reading. 01:41 Optionally, you can include a graphic that demonstrates the problem space. In general, I think the use of graphics and visuals are really valuable and really add a lot to the case studies, So I would recommend doing this the next section is a hypothesis So this is really clearly stating what you believe 02:00 will happen if you solve the problem at hand The hypothesis should be specific and able to be validated or invalidated and it should be in the format of if Blank then blank so couple examples here if Airbnb removed or replaced their cleaning flea then more customers would book through Airbnb an example 02:20 for Google Sheets. If Google Sheets made it easy to import scraped data from the internet, then their user growth would explode. 02:28 So these are very clear ideas or hypothesis, hypotheses that can be validated or invalidated with further research and testing. The next section is the market. 02:39 You want to conduct research to identify market opportunities, trends, and customer needs. So again here, you can look in the news, you can look at different quantitative reports that have been released. 02:51 Statista is a good source for this, you can typically find a lot of good stuff for free there. You could also use chat GPT to brainstorm here, but always find a real source. 03:04 You want to be looking at direct competitors and documenting their solutions, and then you also want to be looking at indirect competitors and document their solutions. 03:13 A good example of this is you may have StubHub which is a ticket marketplace and so people are buying and selling tickets. 03:22 You may want to then look at a direct competitor like ticket master or sea geek and document their solutions, but it could also be valuable to look at indirect competitors. 03:34 So a good example here of a marketplace could be Airbnb where you are kind of, you know, there's one side that's selling something and the other side is buying something. 03:45 So what did they do with their search page and filtering? And can we learn anything from them? And then you want to summarize these findings and takeaways. 03:55 The next is the audience. You want to determine who the target audience is for your problem. So what type of person is really experiencing your problem the most? 04:05 And really get detailed when you're describing them. So what age are they typically are they millennials Gen X Gen Z etc. 04:14 Where do they live like is this a problem specific to the United States or International users also experience it is it a problem that people living in cities experience versus suburbs What is the income of the target user are they high net worth and they have lots of disposable income or are they lower 04:33 income and and that may impact the problem or challenges and solution. What are their interests? So do they like to play music? 04:42 Do they like to travel, eat out, et cetera? What are their pain points? So what causes them frustration or friction with their experience relating to this topic? 04:53 What motivates them in life is family really important to them is making more money really important to them. Find out what motivates them. 05:01 Personas. So this is like a type of person. So it could be like a parent or a student, teenagers, professionals, elderly, et cetera. 05:11 And then finally, job type. Who are, you know, what do these people do for work? Are they hourly workers, blue collar workers, white collar, et cetera? 05:19 Can they work remotely? Are they freelancers? So you don't need to include all of these if they're not applicable. But the more specific you can get at actually defining the target user, The better your solution will be and it always looks good to hiring managers that you get specific with the actual 05:37 target user and their problems. Next is user insights. So you want to try and run user interviews when possible. You want to ask users questions that get to the core of their problem. 05:49 And then from there you want to share interesting quotes that you may have heard during these interviews. And this is why solving a problem for your friends or family members actually is really helpful because it's super easy to get them to do a quick user interview with you. 06:05 You could run user surveys and get data about questions relating to the problem. And from there, share interesting learnings, especially ones that either validate or invalidate your hypothesis. 06:17 You could read online reviews and pull out quotes from user reviews and testimonials about the actual product or service. You could research metrics and stats that you can find online. 06:28 Typically, you know, there's a lot of data out there that really helps people better understand populations. The goal of this section is to really show that you have a strong ability to learn with the target audience really wants, not you. 06:43 This is a huge thing in product management that you really want to step outside of your shoes and into the shoes of your target user, and try to see the world from their point of view, as opposed to your point of view, which may be completely different and have a different set of needs and solutions 07:03 . So to quickly go into a couple examples here, one is with PayPal. So this is one of the case studies on my site, and I go into some context here around why we want to add search onto mobile. 07:18 And I go into how this maps to PayPal's organizational mission of providing convenient products and services to help users take control of their financial lives. 07:29 And I explain that I'll be evaluating the PayPal ecosystem to determine common pain points. I kind of go right here through my thought process and through the sections that will be present in the rest of the case studies. 07:45 So it really sets the stage here. Now, I want to write up front, create a hypothesis. So my hypothesis with this case study is that if PayPal adds universal search to their mobile app, then users will complete core tasks faster. 08:01 And then I dive into the market. So what can we learn from competitors? Again, as I mentioned, I'm going to be looking at direct competitors and indirect competitors. 08:10 In the case of PayPal, like PayPal owns Venmo, so it's not necessarily a competitor, but But it is an app that very directly relates to the industry. 08:19 So in this case, I am showing screenshots over here and I'm kind of writing up a quick summary of what people can do within these screenshots. 08:30 Next, I'm looking at Instagram, which, again, is not a direct competitor. This is an indirect competitor to PayPal in the sense that they also have a search experience on their native app. 08:43 But it's just completely not having to do with financial payments and stuff like that. But we can learn a lot from how they actually think about and have implemented their search because as you may know, meta and Instagram have unlimited resources really. 09:01 So this is after dozens and dozens of iterations and tests. They believe that this is the best version of search for their app. 09:10 Similarly, we can look at eBay, LinkedIn, or Google. Again, these are huge companies that have a lot of resources, and so we can take away learnings from them. 09:20 For example, the search bar is typically on the home tab and first tab, and is at the top of the screen. 09:27 And the search bar usually says search for anything or search so that we don't box the user into thinking they can only search for one thing. 09:35 So I'm really kind of looking at these competitors is in trying to learn from them and identify patterns from them. 09:42 Next is the audience. So who uses PayPal? This is going into their age, what their behavior is. And I'm linking out to sources here. 09:52 So if someone wants to look, they can actually see the real source use cases of PayPal. So I'm really trying to describe what a user can actually use PayPal for. 10:03 And then I go into a summary of like who we should actually focus on with this solution and go into a lot of different contexts here about why I actually chose that. 10:17 User insights. So these are different themes of pain points that the users, the PayPal users may experience when using the app. 10:27 So they may have a hard time finding a contact request money from or send money to. They may have a hard time sifting through a lot of transactions to find the one they want. 10:37 So I'm going through each theme of pain point and documenting them in this section. Before we go to the next section, quickly wanted to show you the product portfolio case study template. 10:48 So this is the one that you will make a copy of on your end and I outlined the different sections of the discover phase here so that's all the other phases. 10:58 So you can use this template to actually document everything that that you're learning before then going and actually turning it into the ultimate presentation on your portfolio. 11:11 So I have context here, hypothesis, market, audience, and the user insights section. Make a copy of this resource and definitely use it as you go through your case study to document all your findings, which will be super easy and valuable when you ultimately want to copy it over into your portfolio.","Learn how to document a product case study’s problem discovery with context, a testable hypothesis, market and audience research, and user insights so you can define the right problem to solve.",00ad3a41-9baf-4f70-a330-712708f92937,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Case Study Part 1: Problem - Discover,4,TRUE,12,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:58.956531+00
b753b5e87a7648a9bced7223a08ff886,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over part two, the problem definition aspect of the case study. So, couple goals and sections within this portion of the case study. 0:11 One is to really visualize the user's journey, summarize different learnings, and present takeaways from the first phase, refine the core problem, and then set the goal. 0:23 So these map to different sections, one, user journey, two, big takeaways, three, the problem and for the goal. So to dive in here, user journey. 0:32 We really want to visualize the current user and customer journey. Like, what are the key moments that lead up to and immediately follow the problem and kind of represent this in a visual way and attach quotes to that user's journey so that people can really empathize with the end user. 0:51 Along the way, you want to document the phases of the user journey, different screenshots, maybe user emotions, whether they're happy frustrated or disappointed, pain points or friction points, like what in the user experience is slowing them down or frustrating them and user thoughts, like what are 1:09 they asking to themselves include quotes. So you don't have to include all of these, although the more that you do include the better, it shows that you really got in depth with it, but again, you don't need to include everything here just at least some components of it. 1:25 Now, the big takeaway section. This is where you're really summarizing the biggest takeaways from what you found when you were analyzing the market, so those competitors, the audience and user insights. 1:39 You take all that and put it together into a concise takeaway section. You're sharing trends you observed and you're You're identifying patterns in the competitors' behavior. 1:51 As mentioned in the previous lesson, you want to consider the indirect competitors as well and analyze their strategies. You in this section want to determine if there's any industry standards that should be followed or moved away from based on the target audience and their specific pain points. 2:08 For example, it may be industry standard to have a checkout experience where people are adding to their cart. But maybe for your specific target audience and the unique problems they have, that isn't the best way for people to buy items. 2:25 Maybe you're reserving something to be picked up. So you want to determine if there is industry standards that should be followed or moved away from for your solution. 2:38 Also, the insights and takeaways you're sharing here should be used later in the double diamond process to actually inform these future decisions. 2:47 So when you're actually looking into the solutions, you want to take into account these big takeaways. Next is the problem. 2:53 So here you want to really refine the original problem into what you think should be solved with your solution based on the research you did during the discover phase. 3:02 So it should be more specific and should have been validated in some way during the discovery and definition phase. An example here is the original problem might be that Airbnb users find the way that fees are displayed to be frustrating and misleading, but the refined problem is that actually we found 3:22 that Airbnb users don't want to pay for the cleaning fees or clean because they believe it should be part of the costs like hotels. 3:30 So maybe they just don't even want to see the fee at all and it just gets looped into the overall price. 3:36 So, the goal here, this section is that you want to set what success looks like for this initiative. And you want to think about this from a couple different angles and you don't need to include all of these, but you want to think from the business's point of view, how is solving this problem beneficial 3:54 ? From the user's point of view, what about the solution is going to help them and provide value to them? Or maybe the internal teams point of view. 4:02 Like what can we do to help our internal team at the company be more efficient or save money? So you want to pick a North Star KPI key performance indicator that you can actually measure success for your solution. 4:17 Good example of this is increased Airbnb booking revenue. It's a clear metric that you can use to target for your solution. 4:26 So want to dive quickly into an example here. So after we looked at the user insights, we're going to look and now piece together things along the user journey. 4:37 So here you can see, like Natalie opens PayPal, she decides to click the payments tab. We're going through what her journey looks like and we're adding in a couple different thoughts that she may be internally having. 4:51 We outline who she is, this is based on our target. User that we addressed above. We're creating a scenario based on what we know about what PayPal users do and setting a couple expectations that she may have. 5:06 So this really helps people to better understand and build empathy with the target user. The next section here is the big takeaways and I have this fun styling to really draw attention to it. 5:19 So this really concisely summarizes the research into a couple quick bullets and then we state the problem in a concise way so PayPal is lacking an easy way to enable their target user to find what they need to find and complete core actions next we want to set the goal so with the solution we want 5:42 to decrease the time it takes to complete core actions so this is really based on the problem we're finding a way to measure our solution to the problem. 5:52 On the PayPal app, by empowering users to search through all content and features available to them from one search box. 5:59 So I'd go into a little more detail there and then later we'll get into the next sections, but these sections are really meant to take everything that we learned from the Discover phase and refine it down into what is the core problem, what is the goal of this case study, what are we trying to really 6:15 do here?","Learn how to define a case study problem by mapping the user journey, summarizing research takeaways, refining the core problem, and setting measurable goals. so you can guide solution decisions with clear success metrics.",45e1c418-9b11-4fdc-a157-f3844f530c48,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Case Study Part 2: Problem - Definition,5,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:59.400071+00
3c20a4037b3c4ba19f38f36b29d90248,"00:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over part three of the case study. This is the solution development stage. So a couple goals here. 00:08 One is prototyping out a couple of solutions, then testing those solutions and refining it to a final solution. MVP definition. 00:32 Every solution ultimately is the sum of many different feature decisions that you will be making. So what button should there be? 00:39 What action should happen when users click those buttons? What notifications and users get? This is really kind of a comprehensive way to think about what goes into your ultimate solution. 00:52 You want to brainstorm all these features. Put together that ultimately solve the problem. And again, the problem is what you define in part two. 01:02 So all the pain points should be addressed. We should be thinking about it in the lens of who is the actual target user. 01:10 Next, you can actually take this list of ideas and perform a rice prioritization on it. So this is a typical framework that product managers may use to help identify really like, what are the highest leverage ideas and features that we should build? 01:26 So there's four components here, reach is the first. This is the total number of users or customers who may be impacted by the feature idea. 01:37 Scale of launch 10, one being low reach, 10 being high. 10 would basically mean that every single user on the platform would use it. 01:48 Most features won't be a 10. But for example, if you are updating the onboarding flow of a product, like 10 is probably what it will be because almost every user is going to go through that onboarding experience. 02:04 The next is impact. So the definition here is like what is the overall estimated impact on revenue, user engagement, customer satisfaction, and can we base this off of any historical data or projections. 02:19 So one here is low impact, 10 is very high impact. So if you think that introducing a new type of house in an Airbnb booking is going to really impact revenue because you think this new house type or apartment type is really an expanded business. 02:40 You may choose to mark impact as an eight or a nine. Confidence is the kind of the level of certainty you have in your estimates above for reaching impact. 02:51 So did you kind of make those up based on your gut or do you actually have clear evidence and facts to back that up. 03:00 So one is low confidence and 10 is high confidence. So this is kind of factoring into the prioritization because you want to be confident that you will have high reach with the solution and you will have high impact. 03:15 And then effort is the last one here. So this is the estimated amount of resources, time and effort. It really requires to complete the feature project. 03:25 So you want to think about complexity, skill set, logistical challenges here. Again, the scale is one low effort to 10 high effort. 03:35 So once you have all of those scores, then the actual formula is reach times impact, times confidence divided by effort. 03:43 And this will eventually spit out a score, in which case you'd want to sort by the highest score top and lowest score on the bottom. 03:52 The next is prioritizing your MVP. So an MVP, minimum viable product, is a product that has just enough features to satisfy the core user pain points you identified. 04:05 And it helps you provide feedback for future development. So you're basically able to get a solution out into the world into the hands of users earlier because you're addressing the core pain points. 04:17 And then you can learn for the future how we can actually improve on this. So the goal of the MVP is to validate your assumptions and learn really what customers want without wasting too much time or money upfront. 04:31 So when you're choosing features for the MVP, you want to focus on what's most essential to deliver value to the customers and achieve the overall product vision. 04:40 So you can use the rice score and your gut to kind of determine this prioritization. And ultimately, the final MVP solution should be positive for the business. 04:52 In this frame of thinking, you want to use the user research and insights. You gathered in the first couple stages of this case study to inform the future selection and sure that the MVP that you're building actually is meeting the needs and desires of your target audience. 05:09 And you want to keep in mind that the MVP is 100% not the final product, But it's rather a starting point for further development in an iteration based on customer feedback and market demand. 05:22 So you'd launch the MVP and then as your product evolves and gains traction, you can add more of those features and functionality to meet the needs of a broader customer base. 05:32 But you never want to start with the complete full solution at the beginning because those typically take a lot longer to actually build out. 05:40 And then you might find out that users didn't even like that solution in the first place. So the solutions explored section is basically acknowledging that there are always multiple ways to design a feature. 05:55 So it's best practice to kind of get a bunch of these options down on paper so they can end up with the best solution. 06:02 So here you should ideally visually show and explain these solutions that you considered. And if you want to go the extra mile, you could turn these solutions all into prototypes and then link to or display a screen recording of the feature or link to the prototype so that anyone can click through it 06:22 . And you could do this through Marvel App, Figma, and Vision prototype. So this is basically these are softwares that allow you to create kind of user interfaces where people can click around and actually engage with the feature. 06:35 Ideally, you should explore at least two, if not three options for your feature. And again, keep in mind that a good solution for you may not be a good solution for the target user. 06:46 So, always keep in mind the target user when you are exploring solutions. Try to step into their shoes to see how they would think about things. 06:55 In terms of user testing, feedback, you should ideally test out each of the solutions with your target users. And so the goal of this part of the case study is to really identify things that users like don't like or things are confused by within your solutions. 07:11 So if you find that the user is like something, definitely keep those in. This is validation from your users and ideally you can provide quotes in the case study, really showing that validation to the viewer. 07:27 The next is things that they don't like so one thing here is that you should figure out why they don't like it should you iterate on it or try again maybe you should just completely remove that aspect of the solution because they really don't like it they're not finding value from it things that they're 07:45 confused by this is absolutely critical if someone is confused in a product it's and it's significantly slow them down from accomplishing what they need to accomplish. 07:55 So if this comes up, you want to figure out what made them confused and what you could do to make them less confused. 08:02 So here, you should definitely iterate on this part of the solution because it may still be valuable, but they're just having trouble understanding it. 08:09 So you want to really outline the biggest takeaways that you had when you were talking to users about your solutions. 08:17 And then from there, you'll end up with a final solution. So again, now that you've tested a couple and gotten feedback from users, it's time to put it all together and outline the final solution. 08:29 Extreme bonus points if you present your solution in high fidelity. This isn't completely necessary but will definitely impress visitors of your portfolio. 08:39 You could hire a designer to polish your designs on fiber, durable or upward, you could also request access to Galileo, which is a new AI product design tool, which is interesting. 08:53 And you really as the product manager want to explain why the solution you went with solves the core user problems. 09:01 So think about questions that a visitor may have about your solution and address it up front. This is a big thing is to kind of really think ahead to when someone is evaluating this solution, like what questions may they have for me as a product manager, and addressing them upfront in the case study 09:19 makes you look super buttoned up. So be critical of your own solution when you do this. Now I'll show a quick example. 09:26 One note here is that in this particular case study, I chose not to include each of these sections to keep it a little bit more concise, but that's really up to you when you're putting together your case study is out of all these sections, which one do you want to include? 09:42 Of course, though, keeping in mind that the more in-depth you get, the better, from the viewer's perspective, because it shows you really took the time to go through and think about all these different aspects of the product development process. 09:56 So in this section, I am looking at the feature prioritization and MVP definition. So I give some blurbs here about how we're going to set up this MVP, key, and then I have these user stories, which are in the framework of, as a blank user, I can do this. 10:16 So as a PayPal user, I can search for things from my home screen, and then I expand and I go into some more detail here. 10:22 As a PayPal user on the search screen, I have quick access to my top items. So go into more detail there. 10:29 So I'm really laying out like, what as a user can I do, and that will inform the solution. So, in this case study, I'm presenting the final solution here, and I opted for using high fidelity mockups here. 10:44 So if you scroll to the top, you can see the existing solution, the existing home page looks like this, with no search bar at the top. 10:54 And then if you scroll down to the final solution here, you can see that a search bar has been added, I'm using different takeaways that I learned from competitors here. 11:06 So I say search PayPal instead of name, email, et cetera, in an effort to not box these or in. Additionally, similar to Instagram, I have a couple of sections or pre and this is also similar to LinkedIn above. 11:21 I have these sections that allow easy access to certain things these are maybe interested in. So I'm really going in depth here to visually display the solution and kind of explain why I made these certain decisions. 11:37 Now, in this particular case study, I decided to add a section called risks and trade-offs. This is optional, but something that you can definitely add that shows that you are really thinking about, okay, if we do introduce this feature into the product, like, what could go wrong? 11:52 So including the search bar the home screen. You know by taking up prominent real estate we may accidentally introduce friction to complete certain actions by pushing the rest of the home content down. 12:05 So I'm really kind of going into detail here and thinking holistically like you know what really is at risk here when we introduce the feature that I outlined above. 12:16 And how should we be thinking about that? So this is the third section of the case study and I will see you in the next lesson which will go over for the deliver phase.","Learn how to prioritize features with RICE and define an MVP, so you can prototype, test, and refine a final solution that addresses core user pain points.",fb839ef4-bd4f-4e76-91f7-943fa5466790,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Case Study Part 3: Solution - Develop,6,TRUE,13,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:00.017522+00
3f269cebd260417c812ab2f1bd5c3ff7,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over the fourth and final part of the case study. This is a solution delivery Congrats You made it to the end of the case study. 00:08 So a couple of goals for this section. One you want to explain how you would actually launch your solution into the world And how would you ensure that it is successful? 00:20 You could also share a future state for the solution and then close out and kind of summarize the case study. 00:25 So really just go beginning to end what did we accomplish with this study? So the sections here kind of mapped to those goals. 00:33 So we have go-to-market strategy, measuring success, future iterations, and then finally closing. So launch and go-to-market strategy. First, why is it important? 00:44 So a launch and go-to-market strategy really helps that ensure that a product launch is successful by outlining the key steps and tactics needed to reach and engage target users. 00:55 So, it helps align the product with the needs and desires of that target user and it communicates the value proposition in a clear and compelling way. 01:05 It also helps set realistic expectations for the launch and ongoing growth of the product and provides a framework for measuring success and making adjustments as needed. 01:15 So that's a little about why it's actually important to have a launching go-to-market strategy. Here is a slide about what to actually include in the strategy. 01:25 So the first is a marketing and distribution plan that outlines the key tactics and channels to be used to reach and engage the target user. 01:34 So social media, email marketing, influencer, outreach, etc. Optionally, you can have a plan that outlines the timeline and milestones for the launch, as well as any events or promotions plans to generate buzz and awareness. 01:49 A kind of a sales and revenue plan could outline the pricing strategy, sales goals, and and revenue projections for the product. 01:56 So will your new product cost more money and then ultimately earn more revenue for the company? Which plan will it be included in? 02:03 So maybe you're a subscription company and there are multiple tiers. So what plan are you gonna be including it in? 02:09 So here are just a couple of ideas of things that you could include in the go-to-market strategy. You don't have to be like super detailed here, but it's good to at least think about this and add some information in. 02:22 The next is measuring success. Now, for this, I would say is critical that you outline this in detail because data and metrics and the ability to measure success is really important in product management. 02:37 It's how a lot of decisions are made. So this is a really important section. So again, it's critical you have the metrics you would use to measure success. 02:47 Again, PMs are very data driven and companies want to know that you actually have an analytical mindset. There are four categories of metrics that you should include. 02:57 So a North Star metric, a leading and lagging indicator, a counter metric, and monitoring metric. So to dive in there, North metric stars in leading lagging indicators. 03:09 So success metrics are basically KPIs, key performance indicators that measure how effective your product, your future is. So you want to be specific and set one main KPI, the North Star metric to track overall success of your product This means like ultimately if this one data point is moved in the 03:30 direction we want to move it in and then we were successful Now we can also have leading indicators and lagging indicators So leading indicators are metrics or data points that can predict future success for your solution So an example here is a funnel click through rate or conversion rate a funnel 03:50 is basically like Step A to be to see how you know how are users progressing through those steps. So 100% of users maybe at step A but only 40% make it step B and then only 20% make it to step C so that's your funnel kind of conversion rate. 04:10 Another couple of leading indicators are maybe average time spent on page or the bounce rate. So if a lot of users are spending a lot of time on your page, that may be a good signal. 04:22 In some cases, it may be a bad signal. Bounce rate. So how many people come to your page and then immediately exit the site? 04:30 So those are a couple of indicators or data points that can predict future success for your solution. Lagging indicators on the other hand are metrics that measure past success. 04:41 So customer support tickets, for example. Ultimately, you may see that customer support tickets go down after you have launched a specific feature, but you wouldn't really see this for a little bit of time. 04:54 Another one is net promoter score. So net promoter score is commonly known as NPS, an NPS score. It's basically when you ask a user on a scale from 1 to 10, and how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend or colleague? 05:12 10 is a promoter, one is a detractor. So on the whole, once you ask a bunch of users this question, you can determine what the net promoter score of the product is. 05:25 So this would come kind of farther down to measure if this solution has contributed to success for your product. Revenue is another one. 05:35 So, a revenue is the kind of ultimate goal for your company to achieve. And this is something that may happen later on once the user has already had the time to go through the funnel, you make use of the feature, etc. 05:52 In terms of counter metrics, so these are metrics that measure the negative outcomes or unintended consequences that may arise by introducing this product or feature. 06:03 They're important because they help PMs really understand the potential downsides of their product or feature launch and take proactive steps to mitigate those risks in some times. 06:14 And by measuring these negative outcomes or unintended consequences, PMs can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions about future development and optimization. 06:26 So a couple of examples of counter metrics are uninstall rates, negative reviews, user your complaints, fraud or abuse rates. So for example, you may have kind of increased revenue for the company, but that kind of resulted in users complaining and writing negative reviews. 06:47 So you did do something good for the company in the short term, you increased revenue, but you're now getting all these complaints and negative reviews, which could hurt the company in the end. 06:57 So now you have to make a decision, like was that feature worth it? Or should we revert and go back to the way things were? 07:05 The future iteration section I think is a really fun section. So it outlines potential changes or additions that you can make to the product to improve its functionality, usability, and value prop. 07:18 So these are opportunities to expand into new markets maybe or new customer segments. So an example of this is internationalization. 07:27 So, you may want to turn your feature, which was originally done in English to other languages, or you might want to distribute this new feature in a different way. 07:38 You could plan for improving the product's technology infrastructure, scalability or performance to better meet the needs of users. For example, your MVP for a specific feature, say, search, could take, you know, 10 seconds to load the search result, which for a product is a pretty long time. 08:00 So in the plan for improving the infrastructure scalability, you might say our goal is to decrease the search result loading time down to one second or 500 milliseconds. 08:13 Another is ideas for partnerships or collaborations with other companies or organizations to enhance the products' capabilities or reach. So you may think about okay what third parties can we integrate with into this feature to enhance it even more so that it provides even more value for users you might 08:33 want to consider how emerging technologies or different trends can impact the product and how the product can stay ahead of the curve so artificial intelligence is a huge thing right now so maybe even if we don't have the capability right now to to integrate artificial intelligence into our solution 08:51 or we just wanted to leave it out of the scope for the MVP because it would have taken too long. 08:57 Let's call that out for the future as a way to improve the experience. Another is to point out plans for ongoing research and feedback to ensure that we continue to meet the needs of the target user. 09:11 And then also it would be good to include strategies for scaling the product and achieving long-term growth and profitability with it. 09:19 You want to make sure that even though a product solution works for a subset of users, we want that solution to work for the vast majority of users and for that to generate profit for the company. 09:31 So this feature iteration section really helps to demonstrate a PM's ability to think strategically about what does the long-term vision look like for the team, what is the direction of the the product took like an identify opportunities for growth and innovation in the future. 09:48 When a hiring manager is looking through this case study, they're gonna look into this section to see like, is this person creative? 09:56 Like, are they thinking about the future or do they have a short view of the future? And they're only considering the kind of immediate next steps. 10:09 So, the closing section is the final section of the case study, congrats, you made it. So in this section, you should really summarize the initial problem that you were trying to solve, what you learned during your research, what's turned into the core problem to solve, and then share a summary of the 10:28 solutions you explored, what you learned when testing it, and then what you finally ended up with. Bonus points to share what you personally learned about yourself, product, tech, and general while going through the case study. 10:41 This adds a little personality and demonstrates that you are constantly learning and improving and improving that you're also a human who went through this case study. 10:49 People like to connect to other people, so introducing this and making it so that not every single section is detailed research oriented and technical adds a little bit to the actual outcome for the viewer. 11:02 So going to go through a quick example here for this section. So after we kind of addressed the risks and tradeoff of our PayPal example, here I'm going into measuring success. 11:12 So I really clearly call out our North Star metric. So for this case, for this case, it's the app open to core use case completion rate. 11:22 And app open is very self explanatory, but core use case completion rate isn't. So I actually define that here. So it's an umbrella metric measuring users who do one of these three actions. 11:34 Then I have this section for secondary metrics here. These are some leading and lagging indicators. So I outline what the actual metric is. 11:47 And then in this specific case study, I decided to have these questions below that kind of add some color. So home view to search start rate. 11:56 You know for here we want to learn how many users are even starting searches to begin with. Is it appealing enough and is the prompt clear for users to search? 12:05 So I outline why I actually want to be looking at these different metrics and then down at the bottom I have some counter metrics. 12:14 So these are again unintended consequences that may be a result of introducing this search functionality on the PayPal app. Then I go into the launch and go to market strategy here. 12:27 So I go into how we want to run this as an AB test. So we want to test this version of the app where the PayPal search bar is visible versus the existing app experience where it's not visible. 12:42 And we're going to be looking again at that primary metric. Then I explain what would happen based on the results here. 12:49 Now, in the future iteration section, I have a brainstorm and I included some visuals here as to what we could do in the future to make this even more valuable. 13:00 So going from that MVP state to like really solving a lot of the problems and pain points that a PayPal user may have. 13:08 So in this instance, making it extremely easy to send a request money from a specific contact that the user may have. 13:18 And then here's my final thoughts closing section. I kind of recap and again summarize what the MVP is aiming to do.","Learn how to deliver a case-study solution with a go-to-market plan, success metrics, and future iterations so you can clearly justify launch decisions and next steps.",73d101e5-9540-4523-aac2-b10f72355655,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Case Study Part 4: Solution - Deliver,7,TRUE,14,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:00.475734+00
93ba290aac574094807c4d585f3ff8b2,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to be going over the about me section of your product portfolio. So the about section on your home page, the purpose is really to provide visitors with a short, a kind of summary of your professional journey. 0:14 It's important for a variety of reasons. One, you want to use this section to differentiate you from other candidates with similar qualifications and experiences. 0:25 So you want to point things out that make you unique. You want to establish a connection with potential employers. So when they're reading it, they could start to get the feeling that like they might want to work with you. 0:36 In this section, you want to help potential employers understand why you're actually passionate about product management and how your experiences in the past have shaped your approach to the field. 0:47 So this is really good for people who are not product managers yet, but looking to transition in explaining what about your past experiences has made you interested in becoming a product manager. 1:00 Additionally, you want to demonstrate that your values align with the company's mission and the values that they have and that you're a good fit for their company culture. 1:10 In this section, the components may be a bio and an image of yourself. Common company values that companies may have, these, I'm going to go through this list and basically you should try when possible to craft your story to actually touch on a couple of these different values. 1:30 So one and maybe the biggest is innovation. Companies want candidates who are prioritizing new and creative solutions to problems. The whole point of the tech world is to innovate. 1:43 Next collaboration. So the best products are built by teams, not by individuals. So you want to emphasize teamwork and communication. 1:54 Continuous learning, fostering a culture of curiosity and personal and professional growth. Hiring managers always want to see product managers that take the time to learn about new ways to do things, new technologies out there that can be leveraged, etc. 2:11 The world kind of moves really fast, so the best product management candidates are ones that are keeping up with the the fast pace world that we live in. 2:22 Diversity and inclusion. So companies really do value different backgrounds and perspectives and want to promote a sense of belonging. So, you know, in what ways can you demonstrate that you also believe that different backgrounds and perspectives are important in creating great product solutions. 2:42 Customer focus is a huge one. So prioritizing the customer's needs and delivering high quality products and services to them. At the end of the day, companies only exist because they're solving problems for specific types of people. 2:58 So you always want to keep that in mind. And this is a type of value that you can demonstrate in your about section. 3:05 Agility. Being able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. As I mentioned before, the world moves really fast. So being able to adapt to it quickly and be action oriented and make decisions creates a great product manager. 3:20 And then finally ethical behavior. Emphasizing that we really want to do the right thing and balance the company needs with societal responsibilities. 3:30 So we don't want to use any tactics that trick users into purchasing something or manipulating them, etc., storing their data in incorrect ways or over-collecting data. 3:45 These are examples of unethical behavior when it comes to the tech world, and you want to definitely steer clear of all of that, and in fact do the opposite, emphasize that you want to do the right thing, while doing so, balancing the company's needs. 4:02 In terms of personal and education background, it's good to share some basic info about your background, anything interesting or unique in terms of aspects of your upbringing that upbringing that really influenced your career path. 4:19 You want to highlight your educational background, so the college or university that you may have attended, degrees earned, and any relevant coursework or certifications that you may have done with your your college or university or like a certification program outside of higher ed. 4:37 You also want to be sure to again include any degrees or certifications that are very relevant to product management or that demonstrate your expertise in a related field. 4:47 So computer science, business or design, like these are really great examples of aspects of being a product manager where if you have formal education around it it looks really good. 4:58 The next is professionally experience. So, detail your professional experience, including your current and previous roles, the companies you've worked for and any key achievements in the neutral. 5:11 You don't need to get too detailed here because in future lessons I'll explain how you will link out to specific pages for those professional experiences, but it's good to just highlight and create a story based on your career. 5:25 The next is skills and strengths. So identify like key skills and strengths that are relevant to product management. So a couple of examples here are design, data analysis, communication, user research, creativity, strategic thinking, or project management. 5:43 And there's plenty of other skills that are relevant to product management. So if you're really good in any of these areas, definitely highlight that in the about section. 5:52 You could optionally include some specific examples that demonstrate your expertise in one of these areas. Another thing to include is professional goals or aspirations. 6:01 So what kind of PMD you want to be in? Like what kind of impact you want to make in this role? 6:07 Another good thing to add could be personal interests or hobbies. This shows that you have a life outside of work and it really humanizes you and makes you more relatable to the potential employer. 6:19 So you might enjoy, say that you enjoy hiking or playing the guitar for example or that you volunteer at a local animal shelter and including different things like this really like might create great connections between you and potential hiring managers. 6:36 This is not something that you typically include in an email and when you're trying to network with someone but if they take the time to look and read through your about me and then maybe they also enjoy hiking there's more of a likelihood that they will actually reach back out to you and set up an 6:52 interview. So I wanted to go through a quick example for my portfolio here. So the top section I hear, I'm outlining that I majored in computer science at this college. 7:05 And I quickly jump into kind of a hook where I mentioned that I developed and launched three iPhone apps with over 15,000 downloads during my time there. 7:14 And that's why I got interested in product management in the first place. Then I dive into the story of what I did after college, so I became a PM really passionate about user experience design, analytics, and growth. 7:29 These are things that I really am interested in and love to work with. So I take the viewer through the story of how I worked on teams at SeaGeek, helping live events fans, and you can notice here that I have a really, I really focus on pointing out that I helped a specific type of customer. 7:54 So for Seaky, it was live event fans, for Squarespace it was small business owners, and for SageSpot it was creators. 8:01 And then I focus on my new position, my goal as a product manager, and then a little into what I do outside of work. 8:11 So the fact that I started a YouTube channel, and I also a food Instagram. So I'm really just creating a cohesive story that gives potential hiring managers an insight, a good insight into who I am, who I want to become, what I'm interested in, et cetera. 8:30 Right, I have a nice kind of graphic of a computer with my YouTube channel there, but this could be a picture of you, you know, at your company, or doing one of these hobbies that you mentioned. 8:44 It's just a way to kind of humanize you and make you seem relatable while also summarizing your experience in the professional world.","Learn how to write an effective portfolio “About Me” section that highlights your story, skills, and values so you can connect with employers and stand out.",fa0ea9e3-2af9-4fee-b6b4-519838491d7b,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,About Me,8,TRUE,9,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:00.933738+00
f65a3399c20b49438bce8f1456b0b206,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over the work portion of your product portfolio. So the work section would be on your home page and the purpose is really to showcase your work experiences and link out to individual company pages. 0:14 It demonstrates your skill set and it starts building trust with potential employers. And it really kind of summaries summarizes your professional experience in a succinct and visual way. 0:26 So a couple components here are the company name, a graphic like their logo, a description, and a button which links out to the actual individual pages. 0:36 So creating the work section on your homepage. You want to use a clean, simple, and consistent layout for each job. 0:44 And you can just kind of use the template that is provided to you with the Squarespace template. You want to display each job with their name, a small graphic, like their logo, or a relevant image that may relate to the actual company, a short description of your role and then a button that again links 1:01 out to that detailed job page. Now when you're creating the individual job page header, you want to include the company's name, a description of your role, optionally the company logo again on that page, a background image that's related to the company or industry that helps the viewer like quickly 1:22 understand what the company is about and kind of the years of employment there. Then you want to showcase projects on that page. 1:30 So divide the page into sections for each project and within each project you can include a relevant picture or graphic, a title and then a brief description of the project. 1:41 So if you have any metrics to share within each section, I think that would be great to really outline different outcomes that you've had with the projects. 1:50 But it's good to show tangible wins that you've had in your previous roles. In terms of selecting and presenting these projects, again, you want to choose projects that highlight your skills and achievements. 2:05 If you are day to day doing the same thing like updating an Excel spreadsheet, this would not be an example of something that you want to highlight on the website. 2:14 You want to focus on projects that are really relevant to the desired product manager role. So maybe in your past role as a data analyst you worked with a team of product managers and engineers to launch a feature So you could use that project on your company page and Communicate to the viewer of the 2:35 page like what your role in that project was So you want to provide context context and results for each project and I think visuals here are very important so that people can easily understand the actual project that you are presenting. 2:54 In terms of tips for an effective work section and job pages, again, it's really important to keep it clean and easy to navigate. 3:03 So you don't want to use colors that are really super distracting. You want it to be simple so that someone can quickly navigate through the site and easily understand what they're looking at. 3:13 Again, tailor your portfolio to the target audience. These are really potential hiring managers that companies you want to work for. 3:22 So think from their lens, like what would they want to look at? Communicate achievements where possible. So if you did have a great win, for example, with one of the projects, definitely include that on the pages. 3:36 And update your portfolio regularly with new experiences and projects. It's always good practice to kind of keep this up to date, especially if you have a new win, add that to your job page so that people can, you know, if they visit it over time, you can see how you are progressing in your career. 3:55 So I wanted to show a quick example of this. So this is the work section of my portfolio page and I outlined the four companies that that I've worked at so far. 4:06 In terms of laying this out, if you've only worked at three, you can delete one and space these out, only two, the same thing. 4:16 And when you actually, again, click into here. So you have the company name, logo, a brief description of what I did, and then a link to view the projects for that company. 4:27 So this page is for Squarespace. Space. And the background is someone working on their computer, maybe building a website. And then down here, I go through and have screenshots since Squarespace is primarily a website. 4:42 All the projects I worked on there, and what we did, why we did it. And I'm just really going through the major accomplishments I had in the role. 4:54 And this is really to supplement at my resume. So when someone comes here, they can visually see all the work that I did. 5:02 And someone, a hire manager would then look at this and say, well, like, you know, Anthony worked on the onboarding flow for the scheduling product on Squarespace. 5:11 So maybe Anthony can work on our onboarding experience for our product. So this is an example of a page. Another example is Seekyq. 5:21 So the background here is a baseball game since Seekyq sells tickets. And here I'm again going through different features and projects that I worked on. 5:31 You know what we did and why we did it. We made it much easier for consergoers to find the cheapest tickets. 5:37 Going through again different screenshots that demonstrate the breadth and complexity of these features. So in only created a screenshot sharing feature, but it was specific to the event versus the listing versus the kind of performer or sports team in this case. 6:01 So all in all, these job pages are a way to specifically show that, you know, you have worked in the past and have transferable skills that make it a no-brainer for a hiring manager to actually hire you for their role.",Learn how to structure your portfolio’s work section and company pages to showcase relevant projects and achievements so you can build credibility with hiring managers.,b24b485b-0c34-40f7-bb98-b6d55f6c5ffb,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,Work,9,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:01.586225+00
dee20cf1b7f1466aabbc9c6f1ba43bcc,"00:01 In this lesson, we're going to go over how to write very powerful resume bullets for a product manager resume. So first, I want you to understand the role of a product manager. 00:12 Product managers are cross-functional and collaborate with various teams like engineering, design, marketing sales, legal, customer support, etc. Product managers conduct market research, they prioritize product development tasks, they set the strategic direction for the product and much more. 00:28 As such, it requires a very diverse skill set ranging from leadership to technical proficiency. Next, I want you to understand these skill sets to highlight on your resume. 00:39 Number one is strategic thinking you have the ability to make decisions taking into account the big picture and the impact on the entire organization. 00:48 Next, cross-functional collaboration, you have the ability to work with people from a variety of different teams across the country, you bring them together to achieve a common goal. 00:57 customer empathy, you have the ability to directly interact and learn from customers, you've experienced understanding and empathizing their customer needs. 01:07 Data analysis, you have the ability to not only collect data, but also draw actionable insights from it, that then derive future changes. 01:14 Leadership, you have the ability to lead a team and manage projects end to end. Communication, you have a strong ability to communicate both verbally and in written forms. 01:24 Finally, technical, you have an understanding of technology and how it can be leveraged to build scalable user experiences. So I want you to keep all this mind in mind when you're actually creating your bullets. 01:36 So now let's write these powerful bullets. Wantifiable impact is absolutely critical for each bullet. You need to emphasize what the end result was of your work. 01:48 Not just listing out the job responsibilities, recruiters and hiring managers want to to see that you are results driven. They want to know if you've had a quantifiable impact in your previous roles. 01:59 This is important for a number of different reasons, but the main thing is that product managers when they're hired, they're hired to actually drive outcomes. 02:08 They come onto a team, they're given five to seven engineers. All of those engineers in all the costs added up is over a million dollars. 02:16 It could be over $2 million. The company wants to know that you leading this team We'll do a good job actually driving impact for the company and the way that they can see this on your resume is through quantifiable achievements in the past. 02:32 And so what I recommend is using the x, y, z format. So x accomplishment measured by y by doing z action. 02:40 So in other words, x impact by y data point by z action. And so you also can do this in the reverse. 02:47 So, Z-Action led to X-Accomplishment measured by Y. In other words, Z-Action resulted in X-Impact by Y data point. So, what are some ways to identify your quantifiable impact? 03:01 So, you always want to ask yourself, quest these questions. Why? Or, so what? How did that actually make a difference for the company? 03:10 What was the impact this had on my team or our customers or our bottom line. What was the magnitude of this achievement? 03:17 Think about why the recruiter or hiring manager should actually care about it. You really want to force yourself to consider the deeper layer of why you did something in your previous role and what impacted actually had on your organization. 03:31 One other way I want it I like to do this is the five wise. So as you can see the starting bullet here may be managed company social media accounts. 03:40 So, on the right, we might ask ourselves why. Well, we did this to create a presence online. Why? Well, we wanted to better reach our audience and build authority. 03:49 Well, why did we want to do that? Well, we wanted to drive prospective customers for our website. Why, though? We wanted to get more customers to convert. 03:57 Why did we want to do that? To increase revenue for the company. So, we go back to the beginning, manage company's social media accounts. 04:05 The ultimate why behind this is that we wanted to do this to increase revenue for the company. So you should actually incorporate this into your final bullet. 04:13 The final bullet here is increased revenue by 10% by driving traffic to product pages through Instagram. So you've now gone from some kind of generic bullet, which doesn't really sound interesting. 04:25 It just explains that you had some responsibility to now you've actually driven impact some actually huge impact in your company by managing the Instagram page. 04:36 So let's list and out and view kind of several examples of powerful bullets just so that you have something to go off of. 04:44 So increased ARR by 500k by launching optimized onboarding flow. The accomplishment here is that you increased annual recurring revenue. The measure of this was $500,000 a year. 04:57 And then you did this by launching an optimized onboarding flow. So you can see the XYZ framework at use here. 05:04 You increase recurring revenue by 500k by launching an optimized onboarding flow. This is extremely clear and to the point, the resume reviewer, either the recruiter or the hiring manager, knows exactly what you accomplished the magnitude of it and then how you actually did that. 05:21 Another, produced support costs by 10% a year by improving help center search. So the accomplishment here is that you reduced support costs. 05:30 The measure of this was 10%, which is a pretty significant amount in terms of cost. And then the action you did, you took to actually achieve this result, this outcome, was improving the help center search experience. 05:44 A couple more examples. You created automated re-engagement email campaigns leading to a 38% increase in users posting content. So this one again, is a flip to where you actually say the action first and then you get to the result. 05:59 So, the Z-Action is created email campaigns. The X-Accomplishment is the increase the number of users posting content, and the way that you actually measure that, the quantifiable impact, is 38%. 06:11 Next, updated payment settings leading to a 130% increase in payment processor connections and 1.2 million in annual recurring revenue. Another built out enterprise scheduling leading to 15 plus new enterprise contracts, increased enterprise ARR by 5x. 06:29 So these are several different examples of bullets that are using this XYZ framework to really emphasize the actual impact the outcome that you had in your role. 06:40 Not just necessarily the job responsibilities where the things you did, it's more so important to emphasize what that actually did for the company, what the outcome was of your work. 06:51 So let's evaluate two bullet points and see which is better. So imagine a marketing analyst who's looking to pivot into PM role. 06:58 Number one, created social media campaigns on meta and YouTube versus increased paid ad click the rate by 40% through rigorous testing on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. 07:09 The second bullet is far better for two main reasons. Number one, it actually states the major impact that you had in this marketing analyst role. 07:17 You don't just have output, you have outcomes, so output is just doing something. And outcome is doing something that changes something else, hopefully for the better. 07:26 Next, it quantifies the impact, so viewers of your resume understand the magnitude of your work. Inquests increasing it click through rate by 40% is significantly better than 1% as an example. 07:39 You want to be clear about the magnitude of your outcomes. It's really important when you're writing these bullets to keep it concise. 07:46 no one has the time to read through very long sentences or paragraphs of accomplishments. Bullets should almost always be one line unless there is a very good reason for it to be, too. 07:57 You want to remove filler and fluff words and really trim it down over time. Cutting stuff out of your bullet points may feel like it's hurting you, but I promise I promise I promise that it will actually help you in the end. 08:09 Extentive detail is left for your interviews not resumes, so you You don't want to jam pack stuff into your resumes because it really won't land. 08:17 As I said in previous slides, recruiters are only spending 7 to 10 seconds on your resume, so if you're including blocks of text, huge chunks of text, they're simply not going to read it and it's not going to help you. 08:31 So here are some examples of keeping it concise. The original bullet may be spearheaded agency-wide OKR initiative that improved goal completion by 50% by collaborating with leadership to establish priorities, seek priorities, assembling a task force and instituting a reporting framework. 08:48 This is very long, it's a very long sentence, and no one is really reading it, and it's not really achieving what it needs to achieve. 08:55 So you could update this and trim it down to spearheaded an agency-wide OKR initiative that improved goal completion by 50%. 09:03 This is actually much more trimmed down, and it actually conveys what you did. you don't need anything else after the fact because you're getting the bulk, the meat of your bullet out in that first part of the bullet. 09:17 Next, pioneered the development of XYZ and educational and community platform connecting marketers and founders utilizing user research to divine value proposition, core features, and go-to-market strategy leading to a 50% year-to-year community growth. 09:33 You could update this to say, launched XYZ, a week-long event educating startups on growth, marketing concepts which generated six enterprise customer leads. 09:43 You're trimming down and you are, you know, incorporating the most important parts here. You did something which did something else. 09:51 It had an outcome. Another led product launch of the XYZ in New York City market that acquired over 800 users and created a product from concept to execution through development of MVP prototype. 10:04 You could trim this down into just one bullet. Launched MVP of XYZ app gaining 800 plus active beta users in the NYC market. 10:13 You're essentially communicating the same thing in a much shorter amount of space, which is really important because the recruiter will then read this and actually take something away from it that you actually launched an MVP you got active beta users in a specific market. 10:29 So here's some tips when trimming your bullets. You want to ask yourself does the rear need to know all this CGL like Willis really make a difference and really think hard about this. 10:39 What is the really important part of the bullet? Think about, you know, what are the words, the specific words that are most important to include on the bullet. 10:49 Think, if I remove this part, will they still get the point? And if so, you should just go ahead and remove it. 10:55 Here are some brief examples of filler words that you can remove. Buy is a good example. increased by 15% can be replaced with just increased 15% or including so just say what was included. 11:08 An example here collaborated with cross functional teams including engineering design sales. That can be replaced and trimmed to collaborated with engineering design sales. 11:18 You're getting the same point across with significantly fewer words. And this again is important that people actually can take away what you want them to take away when they're viewing your resume bullets. 11:30 So, next, you must proofread several times. One of the quickest ways to get rejected during your resume review screening is to have typos or incorrect grammar. 11:40 You wanna make sure to check over your bullets at least two to three times or ask a friend to review them for typos that you may have missed. 11:47 I know I've definitely done this before, but you want to make sure that you do this because it is such a simple mistake to make and you don't wanna be sending your resume out with typos or grammar mistakes. 11:58 You want to make sure to include PM keywords and phrases that a PM or your recruiter or hiring manager would expect to see. 12:05 So you want to check out the PM resume guide which is linked below for a list of these. The keywords may also help when recruiters are searching through resumes. 12:13 This is not an applicant tracking system hack. It's simply to help your recruiter see that you are qualified for the role. 12:21 Your current role or your most recent role if you're unemployed, should have the most bullets attached to it. And then you should lessen it from there. 12:29 So an example, your recent role has six bullet points, the previous one before that is five, and then the ones before that have three to four each. 12:36 Recruiters and hiring managers are most interested in your current and most recent role. So this is really your chance to shine. 12:44 So this has kind of been an overview of what you need to do when you're rethinking and rewriting your resume bullets. 12:51 Remember that one of the most important things is to evaluate your work in the past and make sure that you're highlighting impact. 13:01 The actual impact that you've had in your organization, not just listing out job responsibilities on your resume, and you want to do this while being very concise, as concise as possible. 13:13 Okay, I'll see you in the next lesson about resume formatting.","Learn how to write concise, impact-focused product manager resume bullets using the XYZ framework so you can showcase measurable results that recruiters quickly understand.",4b97e145-3c51-48d0-8dc1-75e8795f6895,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,How to write powerful resume bullets,10,TRUE,14,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:02.514551+00
d6a4b97c2bd64df4b3293d5bbc536a58,"0:00 In this lesson, I'll go over how you should think about formatting your product manager resume. So you want to keep in mind the following, you want to ensure your resume is easily scannable by the human eye, it's not jam packed with content that no one will ever actually read, and it has consistent formatting 0:17 choices throughout. In consistencies like this clearly demonstrate to the people viewing your resume, so either hiring managers or recruiters or even contacts that you're not working with, that you don't have any attention to detail, which is a really important part of the product manager role. 0:33 I cannot emphasize enough that too much content will hurt you. Save it for your interview. You want to remember that recruiters are only spending about 7 to 10 seconds per resume, so you don't want to jam pack stuff onto your resume because it ends up being too much and too distracting and you lose the 0:52 point that you're trying to have the recruiters make with with your resume. So the overall structure should look like this. 0:59 You'll start with your content info. So your name and don't make it in huge fun. Really, what's the point of doing that? 1:05 It just takes up too much space. Your city don't include your full address because recruiters or hiring managers or interviewers could look up your address and it gets kind of sketchy and weird. 1:15 I would just not include it and just say city name like New York, New York. Phone number, email address, you'll wanna hyperlink it and make it black fun. 1:24 I think this is a nice touch. Just for it to not be distracting, but it is there if someone needs to click on it and email you. 1:32 Or folio, if you don't have a portfolio yet, then include a link to your LinkedIn profile, but I want to reiterate that you should make a portfolio as soon as possible. 1:41 So check out those lessons later. And then if you're including a LinkedIn profile link, you want to include a custom URL. 1:49 So you don't want just the generic URL that LinkedIn gives you for your profile. you want to customize it and make it actually be kind of human, human legible. 1:58 So next is the summary. You want to write a short summary and objective statement to provide recruiters and hire managers with a quick picture of who you are and what you're looking for. 2:08 And this is especially important for people who are trying to pivot into the product space from related roles. You want to keep this statement to two to three lines max, preferably just two lines. 2:19 And it's, again, really important for those pivoting in. So, the format should be seeking product manager role at company, x here's experience in blank, and then passionate about blank. 2:30 So, an example here, you can be seeking product manager checkout role at Airbnb, 40 years experience optimizing checkout flows passionate about expanding access to affordable travel. 2:41 This is a great summary statement because it expresses that you're interested in this role. It shows how much experience you have doing what they're looking for, and then ultimately that you're passionate about this space. 2:53 Next, work experience. This is where you're going to list your past roles in reverse chronological order, with an emphasis on the transferable skills relevant to product management that I went over in the previous lesson. 3:04 Reminder, you want to always use action words like lead, delivered, coordinated, and quantifiable achievements whenever possible. For the skill section, you'll want to highlight technical and soft skills that are relevant to a PM role. 3:18 Technical or specific skills are preferred here. So saying something like SQL versus data analysis is preferred, be as SQL is very tangible versus data analysis is very broad. 3:29 Education, you'll want to detail your academic qualifications in any relevant coursework or projects. Like dissertations, if you for example have a PhD, you can exclude a GPA if it's below a 3.0 and you could hide the year of your graduation if you graduated, you know, more than six years ago. 3:48 Use your discretion here. Next, certifications. If you pursued any relevant certifications, definitely include them in this education section. So, formatting consistency is key. 3:59 You want to make sure that you format similar parts of each section the same. So this is things like experience bullets, dates, hiles, company names, locations, sections, headers. 4:10 These are all things that you'll want to make sure are appearing in the same exact way. So an example, you should either have a period at the end of every bullet or no period, but you shouldn't mix and match. 4:22 So you'll want to make sure and go back and look at all of your bullets and make sure they're in the same format, all your dates, titles, etc. 4:29 Example two, you shouldn't have some dates say January the full month 2018 to August 2020, me. And others say, SAP 2020 to d*** 2021. 4:41 This is the shorthand. You want to keep it the same. So choose one of these. They're both fine. But you want to just make sure that they're consistent. 4:48 Consistency is key or next resume length. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want to keep it to one page. 4:55 This can be hard to do. But it is absolutely achievable. If you're over one page and you have less than 10 years experience, you'll want to go through your bullets and really ask yourself if something is critical to include, and if it's not just go ahead and delete it. 5:08 You can save it in a different file for access, but your resume doesn't actually need to be an exact, you know, piece of documentation for every single thing that you did within your previous roles. 5:19 It's really a document to convey to a recruiter or a hiring manager that you have the skill set, the broad skill set, required for the role. 5:27 So you don't need to include every single little detail in there because it's not actually necessary. You'll want to go through bullets that are two lines and trim them down to one line if possible. 5:37 Two lines are usually not worth it and just take up that critical space. You'll also want to consider overall formatting changes. 5:43 So you can consider a different font or a different font size. You can change the margin, et cetera. If you have over 10 years of experience, so as an example, if you're in the year 2024, that means you've been working since before 2014. 5:59 2014, you can definitely go on to two pages, but you'd never want to go onto three pages. There's really no point for this, and people are not even going to read it. 6:09 Next, styling. A common trap that people fall for is styling their resumes and trying to make it fun or styled, adding color, stuff like that. 6:18 This actually can backfire on you. Recruiters are used to scanning normal resumes all day, and so if you make it non-standard, they're actually going to have a much more difficult time looking at your resume and evaluating it for what they're actually looking for. 6:32 And this could backfire on you. You also don't want to include a photo of yourself on your resume. There's no need for this and it can introduce bias into the resume review process. 6:41 You'll want to keep sections clear, so recruiters should be able to easily see all the sections and where one stops and where another begins. 6:49 And then finally, use white space. It helps you break up chunks of information. You don't want to pack it all in without any break in the visual hierarchy. 6:58 This makes it a lot easier to scan. So in action here, duplicate the PM resume template in the description below and then fill in your bullets. 7:07 I think this is the best way to start with a great template, a great foundation that recruiters are actually expecting to see. 7:15 Go ahead and do this and then you'll get started on reworking your resume bullets as well. I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to format a product manager resume for scannability, consistent sections, and appropriate length so you can help recruiters quickly see your fit.",02cf5d84-1a6c-4a97-bf18-65ea97e00a14,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,How to format your PM resume,11,TRUE,8,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:02.948231+00
a13d9f1037504b5aafdf6aea0d5e45d2,"00:00 Welcome to the resume lesson where I'm going over the template that I've given and that you should be using. And then I'll go into uh, the, an example resume, my resume that I used to apply for my last set of jobs. 00:13 Um, and then finally I'll, I'll quickly cover you know information about yourself, there's the summary, professional experiences where you list, you know the companies you've worked at skill section and then finally education. 00:40 Notice that in general everything is on one page. In general there are fewer bullets in the in the experiences that are farther away from the most recent experience. 00:52 So we have seven for the most recent six for the the one before that five and then four. Now this can change of course based on what is actually important within your experience is, but generally it's most important to show the most amount of detail relating to what you've most recently done because 01:11 ideally what you've most recently done is closer to product management than what you first started out doing. So let's dive a little bit deeper into each one here. 01:22 So what I like just to go straight from the top, your name, you don't have to make this in really big fun. 01:29 In fact, a lot of the time, that's a waste of time because it ends up pushing content down and you don't have it as much space for bullets. 01:37 City State, keep it basic, phone number, email, and then your portfolio. When you actually do this, you're going to want to make sure it's a hyperlink so that people can click on it and actually get to your portfolio. 01:50 Next is summary. And I like the use of this line to really just easily see the different sections on your resume. 01:58 They mix scanning a lot easier. So you'll say something like seeking product manager role at Airbnb or whatever it is. 02:08 You'll say, you know, five years experience in whatever, passionate about XYZ, creating beautiful user experiences blah, blah, blah. So this is the place where you're going to actually make it a little bit custom and specific to their role. 02:22 So when someone's reviewing it, they're not going to, you know, see that this is a cookie cutter resume, they're actually to see that you put time into it. 02:31 Next is the professional experience section. So here the companies that have you bolded the city and state will follow and then your title will be right below and it'll be in italics. 02:41 This way it's easy to see, you know, the difference between, okay, this is the company level and this is the title on the right hand side of the company line. 02:50 You're going to see the month and the year that that you actually worked in the position. And then, you know, if it's current, you'll say present. 02:57 Then you have all your bullets, ideally they're staying to one line each. And then you're just, you know, repeating with different companies that you've worked in the past. 03:05 Skills, this is a table. So, you'll be able to fit 12. You know, if you have more, you can always always add. 03:13 Now, this is where gonna be your listing out those soft and hard skills that you've acquired. And then finally down at the bottom, you'll include your section for education. 03:21 So what was the name of the college or university, where was it, what was the degree you got, you know, the name, and then the major, so Bachelor of Science, Computer Science, or Bachelor of Arts, Communications, whatever it is. 03:33 And then GPA, I only list GPA, I advise people to only list if it's above a 3.0. You know, if it's below that, or you, you know, if it's 3.1 or something like that, and you've been out of college for several years and having other experiences, you don't need to include your GPA, just say where you went 03:52 and say the degree. So next I'm going to go into my example, which is my resume that I used to apply for jobs. 04:01 Okay, so here is my resume. And as you can see, it's one page, even though I've been working, you know, have experiences since 2015 here. 04:09 It's just one page. There's more bullets, generally on the more recent experiences than the ones down below. And I'm just going to dive into to different bullet points here to explain my thinking. 04:21 So, okay, defined, you know, right at the top, defined, executed in iterated product strategy in collaboration with CEO, CTO, and broader team. 04:30 This is demonstrating that, okay, I have the ability to come up with a strategy. I can work with different people. 04:36 I can drive something forward and I can work with the C suite executives. I know how to communicate with them. 04:42 So that's one thing that I'm telling the audience, the reader, in this first bullet. Next, launch several key creator tools, including subscriptions, live streams, libraries and engage forums. 04:52 So I'm showing, okay, I have the ability to launch stuff. The next bullet. What did that actually do? Oh, it increased member account creation by 44% and subscription rate by 60%. 05:03 I'm dropping in metrics to show that the work that I've actually done has had quantifiable results. You know, decreased time to production for new features by two to three X by religiously prioritizing. 05:17 You know, as you can see, track user behaviors, KPIs, re-engagement, you know, problem in opportunity spaces, delivered monthly product roadmap reports, setting metric changes. 05:28 So, you know, as you can see through all these buckets, bullets, I'm hitting a bunch of different skills. All the words at the beginning are these action words launched, increased, de-risk, decreased, built out, created, interviewed, delivered. 05:44 These are action verbs to show I'm action oriented. I have results. There's metrics included. If we go down to Squarespace, launched and executed our product strategy for Squarespace scheduling, the first standalone product, okay, you know, why does that matter? 06:01 Well, I increased, or why does it, you know, what did you do here that was so impactful? Well, I increased year-a-year trial to subscription rate of the scheduling product by 47% by AB testing multiple improvements. 06:13 Instead of just saying, I AB tested multiple user experience improvements, I started with the impact. What did I do? I increased the year-a-year trial to subscription rate by 47%. 06:23 I'm including that metric because it's a huge win and I say what, how I actually did it. The next, I updated a payment setting screen, leading to 130% increase in connections. 06:36 So I did a bunch of these things, and they're all communicating different skill sets that one would expect to have as a product manager, and they're showing the results of those skills. 06:49 So 130%, 15 plus new enterprise contracts, these are the types of things that you want to be including, Whenever possible, include a number, you know, try to think how can I actually quantify this because it makes it a lot easier for people to understand the magnitude of the work that you're doing if 07:10 you're including a number. So built out enterprise scheduling, leading to new contracts increased, you know, enterprise annual recurring revenue. Say I didn't include the 15 plus and the 5x, no one would actually have any understanding of what I did. 07:25 I could have landed one contract and it could have increased annual recurring revenue by $1,000 You know no one knows unless you're actually explicitly saying it You know in Seekyke This is another example where okay. 07:39 I increased event shares by 132 percent. I Did a bunch of stuff that increased check out conversion by 19 percent? 07:47 I helped us get our Android Play Store rating from 3.7 to 4.6 I reduced mobile customer support increased by 44%. 07:55 These are all outcomes, things that helped the business. That way, when a recruiter is looking at this resume, they're going to see, okay, you know, this person, they know what they're doing. 08:05 They increased account creation by 44%. They increased payment processor connections and annual recurring revenue for it by 130%. 08:15 They did all these things. Okay, they have these side projects. They got downloads for it, and they developed it themselves, they were an engineer, okay. 08:26 These are the things that they'll quickly just see when they're scanning, and they're all going to be impressed with this different skill set, and they'll say, okay, this person is worth having a conversation in a recruiter screen for it. 08:39 Next, the skill section. So, these are different tools. Figma, Sketch, and Vision are all tools that relate to design, user experience, and prototype testing. 08:47 Amplitude and Google Analytics are two tools used to do user behavior analytics. Maze and user testing are within the research realm. 08:56 Gira GitHub and AirTable are within the project management realm. So making sure your team is on track and then AB testing and analysis and then SQL and Python are two technical skills that I have. 09:08 So SQL is a data analysis language and then Python is a programming language that, you know, you can learn as well online for free. 09:17 And then finally, in the education section, I just have a couple different activities. Eventually, I'll remove these when I, you know, have more positions, more recent, it will professional experiences. 09:28 I don't need to include student government stuff like that. But, you know, this might spark some conversation if someone was involved in those within their time at in college as well. 09:38 So hopefully this gives you an understanding of the types of things that are important to highlight within your resume. Again, it's a very clean design. 09:48 It's very, you know, to the point there's not any distracting design elements or trying to figure out where your eyes should go with all these crazy resume templates. 09:59 This is straight into the point. Boom boom boom that you can see the experiences, you can see when the person worked there, you see the metrics and the outcomes that you had and this is all going to really help you to create a really strong resume to actually get those interviews. 10:17 Okay, and then finally I just wanted to go over this chat to BT resume prompt that you can deploy and basically this is going to help you to make your resume, you know, make the baseline that you're working off of that draft in a better spot. 10:34 So at the top, we're saying focus on showcasing my transferable skills so to get pivot into product management, include the industry, haste in the actual job description for the role that you're applying to. 10:47 And if you want to, you know, what you can do is you can create your baseline resume. and then you can, when you're applying to a new job, put it through this chat to UT prompt, then see what it spits out, see what it recommends. 11:01 It's giving several different guidelines like resume language should be specific, rather than general. Actor, active, rather than passive, articulate rather than flowery. 11:10 Do be consistent in format and content. Don't use personal pronouns, abbreviate, use a narrative style, et cetera. and then it's including a ton of those action verbs that are important to consider. 11:26 Then finally, here's where you're actually pasting your resume down at the bottom. So all of this is going to help. 11:32 Chat UBT understand the context. What it's trying to help you with. And it's gonna make it a lot faster to get your resume into a really good spot. 11:42 Now, I wanna make sure to emphasize that you need to make sure you're actually reading over what is output by chat to be T you know it's been known to make things up in certain places it may change your your experience bullets to be something that isn't actually accurate and you don't want to lie in 11:59 your resume and so make sure that you don't just copy and paste and send it off like you want to make sure that the bullets actually do sound better and you can use your judgment for this hopefully you know you'll be able to see okay you know this way of communicating this bullet is a little bit more 12:15 clear. It's easier for someone to understand so I'm going to use that instead. Use your discretion as you go through this process. 12:21 You don't have to use this but it could be a good tool for you to help. Hopefully that helps you to really understand the foundation of this template, how to use it and fill it in with your bullets. 12:35 Again, I want to emphasize, please, when you're done, you know, go into file, make a copy of this PM resume template, fill it in with your own bullets, you know, make sure the formatting is in a pretty good spot. 12:49 And this doesn't really help you to level up in the actual application phase of your PM journey. All right, let me know if you have any questions and thank you for watching.","Learn how to format a one-page product management resume with quantified, action-verb bullets and tailored summaries so you can increase your chances of getting interviews.",70794e1a-daa4-4150-b62b-482a7cd2839f,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,Using the PM Resume Template + Example PM Resume,12,TRUE,13,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:03.534864+00
9132fde49a5543ff812dfce0e3579487,"0:01 In this lesson, I'm gonna go over how to tailor your resume for specific roles that you're applying to. So you want to customize your resume to the job description essentially. 0:10 So you'll start with your baseline bullets as we discussed in the previous resume lessons. These are the bullets that you came up with your experiences, the quantifiable impact using the XYZ format. 0:22 You'll want to duplicate this resume, so you'll go to Google Docs, you'll click File, make a copy, and you'll name the new file, you know, your name, and then the company. 0:31 company resume. So an example here would be Anthony Saltrailly, Airbnb resume. When applying to jobs, you'll want to update your summary statement to be specific to the company and the role that you're applying to. 0:42 You'll want to tailor your resume to that job. So that means taking a look at the job description and actually see what they're looking for. 0:49 You want to update your bullets to take into account language that they're using. You want to change the order of bullet points based on the job description. 0:57 So So if you have experiences that match up, you'll want to put those higher up on your resume within each job so that there's a higher chance that the recruiter actually sees it. 1:09 And then think in the mind of a recruiter or hiring manager when doing this. Ask yourself, if I was the recruiter for this role, would I pass this resume through to the hiring manager, does it meet what they're looking for? 1:21 Really think about this, because later in your career as a product manager, you're going be the one actually looking through these resumes when it comes time to hiring. 1:31 So think about this yourself, really put yourself in their shoes and try to think, when I'm looking at my resume, would this actually, you know, would I pass this to the next round? 1:41 Would I give this to a hiring manager to interview? Customizing isn't a help you stand out from the recruiting and hiring manager's perspective. 1:50 And they'll think in their heads, wow, this candidate is really perfect. So I want to give an example of how you can actually apply this. 1:57 So let's say we have this product manager opening on the left here for atomic. And there's a couple of different things that we see. 2:05 We see research, build and launch new features from inception to mass adoption. We see unique insights. They're using insights. We see prioritization. 2:14 We see in the bottom, Excel, Google Sheets and SQL. So your baseline bullet that you came up with, maybe analyze data to identify user behavior trends and leveraged findings to guide the development of new product features, leading to a 15% increase in user engagement and enhancing overall customer satisfaction 2:33 . You could update this to be specific to this job posting, to say, analyze data with SQL and Google Sheets, to identify user behavior trends, leverage insights to prioritize new product features, leading to a 15% increase in engagement and feature adoption. 2:49 So you want to do this for each bullet. you want to go look here and make sure that you're using common language. 2:55 And this isn't necessarily to trick an application tracking system. It's really to just show to the recruiter that you actually have the skills necessary for this role. 3:07 The recruiters are not necessarily experts in the role. They are just giving a set of instructions from the hiring manager. 3:13 So there's not a lot for them to go off of other than the actual job description itself. So the more you can make your experience sound like the job description, the better. 3:24 But no, you only want to update bullets if they are truthful. You don't want to change them if it'll result in it not being accurate because this can hurt you down the line. 3:34 You definitely do not want to be lying on your resume. Recruiters will pass through candidates that meet the qualifications the hiring manager is looking for. 3:42 So tip, those attributes are usually included throughout the job description. So So when you're going ahead and editing your resume to tailor it to each job description you want to keep this in mind. 3:53 Okay, so please go out and when you're applying to the next role keep this in mind when you're you're actually preparing your resume to be exported.",Learn how to tailor your resume to each job description by updating summaries and reordering truthful bullets so you can increase your chances of passing recruiter screening.,0ce0e496-9a10-4969-95c6-decda43ee5bf,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,How to tailor your PM resume for specific roles,13,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:03.9862+00
0c5f5e5c552e41ec9e14e560d68bdb97,"0:00 Welcome to the lesson on really understanding where resume and LinkedIn profile optimizations fit in the overall path and strategy to landing a product manager offer. 0:11 So in this lesson, I'm going to go over what I call the accelerated PM offer method. This is basically the strategy that I have refined over the last seven years to landing a product manager offer in a competitive market. 0:24 I'll really teach you exactly why each part of this process is critical to landing offer. and it'll help you give context to where that resume linked in profile optimizations, which we're going over in this course specifically fit into the larger puzzle. 0:41 So the five part accelerated PM offer method is it's really designed to increase the conversion rate at each step of the funnel. 0:51 So the funnel really is going from where you are today as a product management candidate to someone with a product manager offer, a multiple six figure offer where you can join a company as a product manager. 1:03 So the first step really is super charging your resume and LinkedIn profile. This is extremely important because it's critical that you actually have a chance to interview and the resume is that defining moment between just being a perspective candidate and actually interviewing with the company. 1:24 If your resume is not optimized and it is not convincing enough to a recruiter or a hiring manager, you're never going to make it into the first round interviews or the interview loop. 1:35 The companies, they really don't want to interview every single candidate, and so that first step of reviewing resumes is a really massive weed out stage for the companies where they may get 600 applications or 600 resumes and what they're doing is they're only passing through 20 or 30 of those resumes 1:57 to the interview stage because they don't have unlimited time and resources to interview candidates. So your resume is extremely important so that you can really convince a recruiter to be one of those candidates that's passed through to that first round. 2:12 Your LinkedIn is also really important to build authority with people that you're networking with and recruiters as well. They want to trust you. 2:21 They want to see that you're a real person that you have skills. You've worked at companies that are reputable. They want to not view you as a sketchy candidate or someone that is in trustworthy. 2:34 So, that's the first step. The second is launching a captivating product portfolio. video. This is especially important for candidates who are pivoting into the role, but it's also important for existing product managers. 2:48 Essentially, you can only do so much with a resume in a LinkedIn profile because a lot of it is just text-based. 2:55 And today's market, you need to do things really to stand out. And one of the best ways I've found to actually stand out is by launching a product portfolio. 3:05 A portfolio is basically your own personalized website where you're putting out into the world and saying, Hey, you know, my name is Anthony and I have the skills to be a product manager. 3:16 So you might put examples from previous jobs, you know, projects and examples of things that you've done that have transferable skills to product management. 3:26 The other key piece is doing case studies. So basically taking a problem that exists in the world, doing some research on it, and then identifying solutions for it, and putting that up onto your portfolio in a very visual way. 3:41 And this will demonstrate to a recruiter or a hiring manager or just someone you're networking with that, you know, you can be trusted. 3:48 You have this skill set to be an effective product manager. And most candidates don't have a product portfolio. And so if you can actually create one and leverage it when you network with candidates or with that contact that companies, you're going to have a much easier time getting referrals and getting 4:04 into those companies, which leads us to the next step, which is securing referrals from internal employees. A referral is really important because it basically ensures that your resume is actually getting reviewed. 4:18 In today's market, when there's 600 applicants or 1000 applicants, the recruiters aren't actually looking at every single resume. They're just does is it bumps you to the top of that list to make sure that you're actually reviewed for the job. 4:40 If you've ever applied to a role and then six months later you get a rejection email, this is likely because you are just too low on the list of resumes to review. 4:51 A referral basically makes sure that you have a definitive answer within a week or two on whether or not the company wants to interview you. 4:59 So a crazy statistic is that 85% of product management and tech job offers in general are given to people who were referred internally by an employee. 5:12 So doing this is really, really powerful step to help you land a product manager offer. The next step is becoming a top candidate by doing a lot of company research and preparation. 5:24 You know, product managers are different than other types of jobs out there, like a data analyst or a software engineer. 5:31 A data analyst or software engineer just to use those as an example, they can come into a role and kind of just, you know, do the job because they have a, this basic kind of generic skill set, they can either look into data and form insights or they can code. 5:47 They may be able to code in different languages. Now, product management is a bit different because a product manager is really defining the work for the team, and they have to have a lot more specific knowledge about the product area and the business model, you know, whether the product is a healthcare 6:06 product or a financial product or an education product, those products are very different. The business model may be very different, and so, you know, it's really important for the candidate to actually become very knowledgeable of the specific role in the company to show to the interviewers that they 6:27 can be effective if they're hired on day one versus just learning from scratch about the business model or the product and taking a really long time to be effective. 6:37 So what you should do is become this top candidate by doing research upfront about the company, about the product, about their competitors, about the challenges they're facing in potential solutions, thinking about the future of how that product area is going to evolve. 6:54 So that's a really important step. And then finally is, you know, getting offers by really nailing every type of product management interview out there. 7:03 So that's product sense, product analytics, product strategy, the technical, interview, the behavioral interview. There's several of these unique product management interview types that you really need to become an expert in because there's ultimately one person getting an offer at the end of the interview 7:20 loop. And it's really the person who is able to interview at their best ability. So these are kind of all the steps really that I've found that are important to landing an offer in today's market. 7:35 So I just wanted to quickly, you know, I've already touched on a bit why each party is critical, but I wanted to demonstrate why at a high level these are really important. 7:44 So the reason is that the product management market is really, really competitive these days. Because of tech layoffs that have happened in recent months and years, there's lots of qualified candidates out there on the market that you're actually competing against. 8:00 At the same time, there aren't as many openings because companies are being more conservative in their hiring plans. Companies are striving for profitability. 8:10 They want to generate a profit, and typically their biggest expense is their employee base. If you think about a team that has five people on it and each one is making $200,000, that's a million dollar team that the company has to pay for. 8:26 So what does this really mean? Hundreds of people are applying for one role out there. The candidates that are getting the offers are really the top 1% of candidates and companies really are able to hire the perfect candidate for the role just because there's so many options out there for them. 8:45 So kind of this is why all these steps are really important and you understand that the product management resume and LinkedIn profile is that first critical step in this path. 8:55 So definitely check out my other courses to learn all the other parts of the accelerated PM offer method. And of course, if you have any questions about how to get this additional help and learn more about the different steps, reach out to my email at supportfpmcreacadalyst.com. 9:12 All right, I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to apply the five-step accelerated PM offer method so you can prioritize resume, portfolio, referrals, prep, and interviews to land a product manager offer.",0acd58e2-f19d-40c8-8ebc-8ee1d66d30ae,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,Where Resume & LinkedIn optimization fit in the path to landing a PM offer,2,TRUE,10,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:04.631302+00
2bd32da067784a4691d0a98457fcb4d1,"0:00 In this lesson, we're going to go over the goal of product management hiring, and what hiring managers actually expect out of Canada. 0:08 So there are really two scenarios a product manager role is opened within a company. Number one is backfilling a PM position, so this may mean an existing product manager who left the role somehow, either to a new team, or they left the company altogether. 0:24 So in this scenario, there's an established team, there's established processes, strategy in roadmap, and the product manager is coming in to fill in that gap. 0:33 The other scenario is hiring a PM for a new team. So in this scenario, the leadership team at the company has decided to spin up a new team to solve some type of problem or work on some new product. 0:45 This is a new team, again, they will have to be hired and onboarded. So the product manager, the engineers, and the team, etc., and this PM will be responsible for establishing processes, strategy, roadmap, etc. 0:57 So the goal of a hiring manager is to find the top candidate given that context in the shortest amount of time possible without disrupting too many members of their team and someone who can get started soon and drive impact. 1:13 So these are the different pieces of context that you should have in mind from the hiring managers perspective about the roles that they're opening. 1:21 So here's what hiring managers are actually looking for. They're looking for the best candidate. And this is someone who checks all the boxes of requirements for the role, so this could be things like a number of years for professional experience, specific expertise for the role. 1:37 Additionally, it is someone who blows away every single interviewer out there, so strong yeses or yes for all the interviewers. 1:45 They're looking for someone who is the least risky candidate for the position. They have no or very minor hesitations from the hiring committee. 1:53 And finally, they're looking for someone, the best candidate, is someone who has a competitive edge against another candidate, something that makes them that little bit better. 2:03 And so your goal in this entire process is to be the absolute best candidate for that specific role that you're targeting. 2:11 And in all the lessons in this program, we're going to go over how to exactly do that.",Learn how to identify why a PM role is open and what hiring managers prioritize so you can position yourself as the lowest-risk top candidate.,e59b4cfb-70b7-4e80-ad11-cbb0ba6a2d15,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,Understanding the goal of Product Management hiring,3,TRUE,3,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:05.092358+00
5337058bb0334578a74f9a610eb52bb6,"0:00 In this lesson, I wanted to go over how hiring a product manager works behind the scenes so that you can understand really what the journey is to from beginning to end to actually getting an offer. 0:11 So, the recruiter and the hiring manager will get together and they'll open a job description they'll publish that online and they'll start to receive applications either directly through the job portal or through referrals from internal employees. 0:25 The recruiter and hiring manager will then review resumes one by one and decide, which ones warrant a recruiter call. So the recruiter may do an initial pass here and say let 50 resumes through and then the hiring manager would do another pass to really decide between that smaller set of applications 0:43 which ones warrant a recruiter call. The recruiter will then have this initial screening call with the candidates that made it pass the resume review round. 0:52 The candidates that pass that That router then moved to the higher manager round, which is typically a 30 to 45 minute call, either a phone call, or most often times a video call to chat more directly with the candidate, candidates that then pass that round may receive a take home assignment. 1:09 So this could be solving some type of problem in written form, so either a document or a presentation, candidates that then pass that are moved to a final round interview. 1:20 Otherwise, known as an on-site interview, this is typically between three to six hours long, and it is across several different interviewers and interview types. 1:29 Think product sense, analytic execution, product strategy, behavioral, technical, etc. Candidates that then pass that round may have one additional executive interview. 1:40 This is sometimes optional within a company, but you may talk to a VP or the chief technology officer, etc. And then candidates are evaluated against one another by the hiring manager and the interviewers. 1:53 The best candidate is given an offer and then the other candidates are stacked ranked outside of that in case the best candidate who is given an offer declines that offer. 2:03 So if they decline, then they know exactly what order they will give the offer to next. So this is typically basically what it looks like in terms of the funnel for one job. 2:14 So if you open a job for a product manager these days, there may be 500 or 1,000 candidates who apply. 2:22 Then about 15 to 25 of those candidates may be set up with a recruiter call about, you know, 5 to 10 candidates eventually get through the hiring manager calls and are evaluated in a final interview. 2:35 So basically between five and ten candidates are doing that three to six hour final round interview And then ultimately one candidate is getting the offer if they accept it, then that's it If they decline it that offer would go to the next person in in the stack rank. 2:51 So let's use an example for a role Let's say this was candidate a who got a four to four from interviewer one and it's three out of four from interviewers two three and four Canada B got a 4 out of 4 from interviewers 1, 2 and 4, but a 3 out of 4 from interviewer 3. 3:12 Then finally we have the 3rd candidate, Canada C. They got a 4 out of 4 from interviewer 1, 3 out of 4 from interviewer 2, 2 out of 4 from interviewer 3, and a 3 out of 4 from interviewer 4. 3:26 So if you add up and average out these scores for each candidate, you see the Canada A had a 3.25, candidate B, 3.75 and candidate C with a 3.00. 3:38 So in this scenario, candidate B would be the one getting the offer. A 4 out of 4 equates to a strong yes from the interviewer. 3:46 A 3 out of 4 is a yes. 2 out of 4 is no and 1 out of 4 is a strong no. 3:51 So candidate B had by far the most consistently high scores from each of their interviewers in the final round, and that's the candidate who would be getting the offer. 4:01 If that candidate then declines because they had a different offer from another company, the offer may go to candidate B, or sorry, candidate A as they were second in the stack rank. 4:11 However, since candidate A had, you know, just yeses, for most of the candidates and only one strong yes, the interviewing team, the hiring committee, may decide, hey, we actually want to talk to more candidates, we think that if we do more rounds, we'll be able to get someone closer to candidate B, 4:30 someone with a bit higher scores across the board. So I just wanted to show this example to kind of give you more visibility into what happens behind the scenes of the hiring process for a product manager role. 4:43 All right, I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how the product manager hiring funnel and interview scoring work so you can better prepare for each stage and interpret offer decisions.,915acd86-31ab-4495-afb2-25bd3dd39621,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,How hiring Product Managers works behind the scenes,4,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:05.54023+00
d87b88107a574f4fabba4d03fa98aa4e,"00:01 Finding out your four-vector fit is an important part of your career strategy. In this lesson, we'll be going over how you can hand-pick the best jobs that you should be applying for. 00:10 In order to increase your chances of getting an interview, you'll need to put in extra work for each application, namely around getting referrals. 00:18 And because of this, you'll need to be more selective around what jobs you actually end up applying for, since each application is going to take a bit more time. 00:27 So, why does being selective matter? Well, job hunting is very similar to fishing. Throwing a net into 20 random spots in the ocean will never be as effective as throwing a net into 5 specific spots that are almost guaranteed to have fish. 00:42 So, I want to reiterate quality over quantity here. Applying to every job out there that you can see is not only overwhelming, but it's also inefficient. 00:50 But targeting the right roles, the right jobs increases your chances of actually getting an interview and it avoids burnout. Now, next is Employer's Market, because there are so many candidates nowadays, companies are very selective with who they actually interview. 01:05 They won't waste time on you if you don't actually appear qualified for the role. Next you have more time to focus on the best leads, having an interview just to have one won't really help, aside from getting additional practice. 01:18 And that's because each interview requires a lot of preparation. So you might be thinking, but the more I apply, the better my chances, right? 01:25 and the answer is not necessarily. Quality over quantity is the name of the game here. Vertity dive into why investing quality time in each application not only increases your chances, but also saves you from the unnecessary frustration and disappointment that comes with rejection after rejection. 01:43 And I just wanted to note that quantity is still important here. It's still an important factor, but it's just not the most important factor. 01:51 So how can you increase your chances of an interview? companies are looking for very specific people to fill their roles. 01:58 They're not looking for generous who can just do it all. And because of this, you want to figure out what types of specific roles should you be applying for. 02:07 But good way to get specific here is what I call the four vector fit. So the four vectors are number one technology, number two, business model, number three, role type, number four, industry. 02:19 Having all four vectors here will increase your chances at an interview significantly. So as you see on this chart on the right, your chance at getting an interview goes up as the number of vectors you have in alignment with that job go up. 02:35 So we're going to dive into an example here. So which candidate would the recruiter pass through resonate review? So think that the role is a growth product manager role. 02:45 It's on a search and marketplace team and the company is docked. So you have candidate A here who has experience in sales for a native desktop B to B real estate platform. 02:56 Prior to that, he was a real estate agent. He has a real estate license and certification. Candidate B is a marketing analyst at BetterHelp, which is a mental health platform. 03:07 They're focused on increasing user acquisition. Prior to that, they enter into the hospital and they volunteer as an EMT on the side. 03:14 It's very clear that Candidate B is a much better fit for this role. Z******* is a company that operates in the health tech space. 03:22 The team is around search and marketplace, which is really focused on user acquisition. So this candidate B has a lot in line in alignment with the role. 03:31 And so if the recruiter is looking through resumes, they're looking through people, they're definitely in a pass on candidate A. 03:37 They're definitely going to push candidate B forward for a recruiter call. So let's now dive dive into each of the vectors here. 03:46 the first one being technology fit. Every company has a different technology stack that they work with. A tech stack is essentially what systems or tools or computer programming languages they use to run the platform. 03:59 They may be looking for candidates with prior experience working on products that leverage a specific type of technology. Some examples are native mobile on iOS or Android. 04:09 This is iPhone apps or Android apps. Machine learning or artificial intelligence. these are algorithms that essentially can take a data set and make determinations based off of it. 04:21 Virtual reality, blockchain, etc. They may also be looking for candidates who have experienced with certain tools and platforms such as amplitude which is a data product analytics platform or snowflake which is another analytics platform. 04:35 Having technology fit can demonstrate that you have the skills and knowledge to be effective with the nuances between these different tools and systems that the company uses. 04:45 The whole idea here is that if you have experience, for example, working on a native mobile app, you'd be able to hit the ground running if you were hired into a new PM role that addressed and had a mobile app as their product. 05:00 Okay, moving on is business model fit. Every company has a different business model. In other words, how do they make money? 05:07 They may be looking for candidates with prior experience with that specific type a business model. So some examples of models here, content platforms that run on ad revenue, a three-way marketplace, a two-way marketplace. 05:20 So an example of a three-way marketplace could be Uber, which has, or Uber Eats, restaurants, careers, and the customers. A two-way marketplace is something like Airbnb where there's a buyer in a salad. 05:34 There's someone who's traveling than there's a host, subscription-based B2B businesses, e-commerce, etc. Each business model has its own nuances and understanding how the company makes its money can help you be more effective in your role. 05:49 Because of this, if you have prior experience with a specific business model, you'll be viewed much more attractively than if you don't. 05:56 Okay, moving along to role fit, there are various types of product management roles out there, choosing one that best fits with your background will help you have a leg up. 06:05 So, for example, there are technical PMs. Do you have tech experience? Do you have a computer science degree? Experience with data or data science? 06:14 There's platform PMs. Do you have experience working on systems that support internal teams? There are mobile PMs. Do you have experience working on an iOS or Android app? 06:24 Web PMs. Experience working with a website product, a web app. Internal tool PMs. Do you have experience either using internal tools or improving them or both. 06:34 Growth PMs do you have marketing experience, growth experience, experience with data or running tests, experiments, AB tests? Companies are looking for PMs who have experience and skills that align with their specific role. 06:47 For example, platform PMs deal with vastly different problem spaces than growth PMs, so it may be difficult to transition between these two. 06:56 For example, of more roll tapes, please visit the lesson linked below. So next is Industry Fit. This is arguably one of the most important and powerful vectors. 07:08 Companies look for candidates who have prior experience in the specific industry they operate in and may prefer those who already have knowledge of their field. 07:16 Having experience in the same industry as the company can make it easier for you to understand their business and customer needs as well as the competitive landscape. 07:24 So a couple examples here, you could have health tech. This is technology for health care like telemedicine or wearable devices. 07:32 FinTech, financial technology, so online banks, investment apps, mobile payments, etc. Education technology, so e-learning platforms, online courses, etc. So you can pause the screen here and just look at all the different types of industries out there that have technology products and see which ones 07:51 align to your background. So the next thing I want you to do is find your four-vector fit and jobs that will fit those vectors So now that you know all the vectors you want to try to figure out which ones you closely aligned to and then this will map to what jobs You end up applying to so an example 08:10 Technology I previously worked at a company that had an iOS app business model I previously worked at a company that managed a marketplace role fit my team was in charge of increasing in app revenue and then finally industry fit live events then I would find jobs that match some or all of these vectors 08:28 so example jobs that match the above example vectors are a step hub mobile growth PM or an event break mobile PM or an Airbnb mobile product manager etc so in terms of order operations at any given time there may be hundreds or thousands of open product manager roles. 08:47 Therefore, you need a game plan of which ones you should try to apply to first. So you want to start in order of roles that have high four vector fit going to low four vector fit. 08:58 So the roles that you need to prioritize applying to first are the ones that you are in extreme alignment with. 09:05 And if those are, you know, you start to apply to all of those and there are fewer of them, then you could start moving down the line to apply to roles where you don't have as many vectors in alignment. 09:15 In terms of the most important vectors to least important vectors, I would say it's in this order. Industry is extremely important because every industry is so different and there's so many nuances to each industry. 09:27 If you have experience in one, it's so much more likely that you'll be considered for a role than someone who does not have experience in that industry. 09:35 Next, I would say is role type. So if you have experience on a growth growth team, you're much more likely to be considered for a growth role compared to someone who has internal tools experience. 09:47 Business models next and then technology is last because with technology, product managers need to understand the technology, but they're not necessarily the ones using it or programming with it. 09:58 That's up to the engineers. So it's a little bit less important, but it still applies here. So I just wanted to make a note that all of these are important, but I want you to use this ordering as a mental model for where you should optimize. 10:09 So with that being said, please go out there and start to figure out what is your four vector fit. Really take time thinking about this and then when it comes to applying to jobs, you'll be evaluating your experience against the four vectors of the role. 10:25 I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to evaluate product manager job postings using the four-vector fit (industry, role type, business model, technology) so you can prioritize applications that maximize interview chances.",251f7e72-2331-457f-ae9a-e0c233a1b2b6,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,Understanding what PM roles to target: 4 Vector Fit,5,TRUE,11,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:06.008675+00
ebb0d26b8c50458c9fcf176ea4e61284,"0:00 In this video, I wanted to go over how you should think about choosing between targeting small companies versus big companies. 0:07 So on this chart, I wanted to show that different companies operate in different spaces. So on the x-axis here, we have speed going to bureaucracy. 0:17 Then on the y-axis, we have 0 to 1 and a large scope, going up to optimizations and small scope. To explain these in a bit more detail, speed refers to how quickly things actually go at the company. 0:30 Are you moving really faster, you're shipping faster, you're trying to do things in a quick manner to grow the company versus bureaucracy? 0:38 This is, you know, there's different layers of approval, there's politics, there's things that are getting in the way of actually shipping features and making progress. 0:47 On this access, zero to one refers to launching features completely from scratch. So starting with zero and getting a first version of it out, you have a very large scope. 0:57 So you have a lot on your plate, you are responsible as the product manager for a lot of different product surface areas versus up here optimizations. 1:06 These are, you know, existing feature sets and your job is to optimize them. So you may already have an onboarding flow and your goal is to increase the conversion rate or the completion rate of the onboarding flow by 1% or 5%. 1:21 Generally, you have a much smaller scope, you know, in these types of roles. So I wanted to just highlight that startups operate in this space where they're moving very very fast and you have a very large scope and you're doing a lot of zero to one work medium and growth stage companies operate kind 1:39 of in the middle so they're not necessarily moving as fast as startups but they're not yet burdened by you know all the red tape and layers of approval of a massive company in terms of scope they're sitting somewhere in the middle you know they aren't necessarily literally building things from zero to 1:56 one all the time, they're doing that sometimes, but they're also making optimizations. So it sits kind of in the middle here, and you know, at a medium or growth stage company, there may be less than 15 product managers at the company or less than 10. 2:11 And that means that you probably will end up owning a pretty substantial portion of the product, but you won't be owning multiple product areas, for example. 2:20 And then we have big company up here. So, in big companies, things are much slower, there's a lot more red tape, there's a lot more politics, there's a lot more stakeholder management that you actually have to deal with. 2:31 And you're generally dealing with a smaller scope. You're working on optimizations, you're working on fixing bugs. You may do some zero to one work as you get more experience to grow into more leadership roles, but especially entry-level product managers that big companies are typically owning, you know 2:51 , more minor parts of the product. Now, all these parts of the product are still important to the bigger piece of, you know, the bigger puzzle. 3:00 But they're not as kind of big and large in scope as what you may experience in a startup role. So I just wanted to go over some examples here. 3:10 So for a big company, your scope could be an internal tool that does a defined set of things, and your day-to-day might look like collaborating with relevant stakeholders, gaining consensus amongst them, information dissemination, et cetera. 3:24 Now let's look at a startup. Your scope may be several key product features, and your day-to-day might be scoping new functionality and working with engineers directly to deliver it. 3:34 There are no stakeholders really to work with, or information to disseminate to other teams because the company is so small as it is. 3:42 So this is just, you know, not exactly what they would be doing day to day every single day, but just to give you an example of the kind of differences between startups and big companies. 3:53 And companies want candidates who have worked in companies of similar size and resources. In fact, in an interview I had at a large company, the interviewer, the hiring managers literally said, I actually only want to hear about your experience from one of the big companies that I worked in the past. 4:11 This was really interesting to me. They actually didn't, even though I had worked in a startup, they didn't want to hear anything about it. 4:17 And the reason is because in the company, in the big company, the problems I'd be dealing with were vastly different. 4:25 I wouldn't be working on customer support emails. I wouldn't be working on copywriting or research. All those different job functions are handled at the big company. 4:36 And so it's a, it's just a different skill set. And so companies want candidates who have already kind of worked on that skill so that they've honed in on those skills So company size impacts your targets It comes into play with several things resumes linked in interviewing you want to keep in the company 4:54 size that you are Targeting when you write your resume and you write your LinkedIn and when you're interviewing When targeting companies to apply to you should choose companies that are of a similar size that have a similar set of resources So, for example, if you didn't have UX researchers, you'll want 5:15 to target companies that also didn't have user researchers, because you have that skill now. You probably did work on developing that skill and doing research yourself. 5:24 Copy Raiders versus no copy Raiders. Product Support Specialists versus no Product Support Specialists. Or, you know, generally, looking for skills you would have based on the company size you worked at. 5:35 So, I hope this lesson was helpful in understanding kind of the differences between big companies, small companies, medium companies, and everywhere in between, and how this should actually impact your job search. 5:48 I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to evaluate startups versus big companies by speed, bureaucracy, and scope so you can target roles and tailor your resume, LinkedIn, and interviews.",f8343b71-d27a-44c0-9fe6-2cb61c45e89e,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,How big companies differ from small companies for PMs,6,TRUE,6,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:06.470155+00
df0051cf499644ccbb78741797a3b051,"0:01 In this lesson, I wanted to go over how you should turn your background into a career strategy. So, you want to target companies that you have a high chance at getting an offer for. 0:12 So let's look first at your four levels of vector fit. So let's say you have all four vectors in alignment. 0:20 This means you're a one-of-one candidate, you are perfect for this role. The next level is three, if three vectors in alignment, this means you're uniquely qualified for the role. 0:29 so you have a better chance than most candidates out there. Two vectors in alignment means you check some boxes. This could be a toss-up. 0:38 And then one, a low fit, you're very unlikely to land an interview unless your one vector fit is industry. Company size, you should look into whether or not you have a skill set consistent with launching things 0 to 1 versus making optimizations. 0:55 Having a small scope versus a large scope, No resources versus resources, speed versus bureaucracy in politics and skills. So you want to take all these different things. 1:05 You want to evaluate your fit. So what makes up you, what technologies do you know, what business models, industries, roles, and then you want to consider the company sizes, the size of companies you've worked at in the past are, and then compare and contrast that with companies that you're evaluating 1:24 . So I just wanted to show you this as an example, every time you come across a job, you want to evaluate, therefore, vectors and company size and then compare it to yours. 1:34 Let's take Airbnb as an example. Maybe you have the industry in alignment, but you don't have the business model technology, role type, or company size. 1:42 This is likely not going to be a great option for you. Airbnb recruiters are likely not going to pass your resume through. 1:49 Versus, let's look at Alma. You actually have every single vector in alignment, including company size. You may have worked for another healthcare technology company that has a similar business model, uses similar technology, so web applications. 2:04 You may have worked in the same role before. Applying to this role, your chances at actually getting an interview are significantly higher. 2:12 And the reason this matters so much is that in future lessons, you're going to learn that every, you know, ounce of energy you have should be going into trying to get a referral, and you cannot try to do that at every single company out there. 2:25 Imagine if you did that for all these different companies. It would take a lot of time, and you really wouldn't have as good of a chance at Airbnb and birds, less of a chance at Wallow and Flow. 2:36 But if you actually just target your search to a company like Alma where you have everything in alignment, the chances that you You actually end up getting your referral, go up significantly, and that can lead into an interview, and then ultimately an offer. 2:52 So hopefully this helps you understand how to put all the pieces together here to really target the right companies in your career search. 3:01 In future lessons, we're going to be deep diving into everything you need to know to actually improve your career assets, launch a product portfolio, network effectively, interview you effectively, etc. 3:14 But I wanted to have you kind of review these lessons early on so that you have an understanding going into all of those different aspects of the accelerated PM offer method so that you can keep it in mind when building your assets and working on improving your interviewing skill set. 3:32 Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to evaluate job opportunities using four fit vectors and company size so you can target roles where you’re most likely to earn interviews and offers.,1aea9452-b731-4289-a028-c449d06b039c,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,Turn your background into a strong PM career strategy,7,TRUE,4,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:06.911125+00
7bd657835e3949a8985c903590a0ae49,"0:01 In this lesson, we're reading over what recruiters and hiring managers are actually looking for in your resume. So I first want its touch on why your resume matters. 0:09 When you eventually apply to a role, either directly through a job board or through a referral, which is very much preferred, your resume is the definitive asset that will decide your feet. 0:20 You'll either get the chance to interview, or your journey for that role will end there. This is why it is so important that your resume is as strong as it possibly can be. 0:30 And when we say strong, there are really two parts to it, formatting and content, and we're going to dive into these in future lessons. 0:36 But next, I wanted to go into what recruiters are actually looking for. So recruiters who are real humans, real employees of the company, they're looking at your resume to make a decision to move you forward or not. 0:48 And before they review resumes, they meet with the hiring manager to understand a couple things. So business context and needs, why was this role opened, what are they actually going to be doing, what do they need to understand to be effective in their role? 1:02 What are some target attributes? So things like current role and company size or stage or a year's experience or experience with specific product areas, technologies, roles, business models, et cetera, industry and education background. 1:16 Maybe that's going to be an interesting or relevant target attribute for the recruiter to look for. So a couple of examples here, imagine a product manager of payments experience role opens up at a ride share company, so like Uber or Lyft. 1:30 The hiring manager may say to the recruiter the following. I want someone who's worked in large organizations and has experience working with payments, checkout or money movement in general. 1:40 An ideal candidate would be someone from Stripe or Square or Shopify who has worked on checkout pages before. I want minimum four years in a related role or one year in a product role, and that is then what But the recruiter is going to use to go off of when they review resumes. 1:56 Example two, imagine an associate product manager of the Marketplace team. This role may open up at a health technology company startup. 2:05 So, the hiring manager may say to the recruiter, I want someone who has worked in a startup or growth stage company before. 2:11 This is because they likely have honed in on a certain skill set that is effective in a startup, wearing a lot of hats. 2:18 And ideal candidate is someone who has worked with marketplaces before in some capacity. And a preferred background is someone with growth marketing experience and minimum two years professional experience in tech or marketing role or they have a technology kind of bachelor's degree. 2:35 So think computer science. So why do they do this? Well, the supply versus demand curve is in the favor of companies right now. 2:44 Now, companies can find ideal candidates that check all of their boxes, so why wouldn't they filter out everyone else? Recruiters and hiring managers are very busy people. 2:54 They only have so much time to dedicate hiring, and so because of this, they're selected with who passes through for a first round interview. 3:02 They're even more critical of who they then pass through to a final round interview, because this typically will involve 46 more people and hours of their time. 3:10 It's not uncommon for a pass-through rate of resumes to be less than 5% of all applicants for a popular company or role. 3:19 Also remember, recruiters are spending about 7-10 seconds looking at your resume during the initial screening process. This is why you must make your resume extremely strong. 3:31 One of the biggest mistakes that you could make in your career journey is thinking that your resume content and formatting is already perfect and skipping over this. 3:39 So I want you to save these lessons seriously and really think about improving your resume so that you can get past these resume review screens that the recruiters are actually doing. 3:51 Alright, I'll see you in the next lessons to deep dive into how to actually improve your resume.",Learn how to tailor your resume to the specific attributes recruiters screen for so you can pass initial resume reviews and earn interviews.,141a97c1-50b0-41f4-b4a0-bab5195b4597,633385c5-c3a7-4971-a2f6-bcb65aab9d9e,What recruiters are looking for in Product Manager candidates,8,TRUE,4,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:07.458369+00

13d5a634387b44a6b44448272e16ea86,"0:00 Hello and welcome to the foolproof PM networking system in these several lessons. I'm going to go over the following number one How do I identify and connect with the right people to how to improve your skills when you're networking? 0:14 So you're actually gonna feel more confident when doing it and when talking to other people. Three, how to approach and engage people in a way that really encourages them to offer support and guidance without appearing desperate or demanding in any way, which is typically things that you want to avoid 0:32 . How to foster authentic relationships and build out these long lasting connections in the product management world. And then finally, how to communicate your career transition to your existing network and seek their support and encouragement. 0:45 So in this first lesson here, I'm going to go over mainly the importance of networking. And, to put it bluntly, it's estimated that 85% of job offers are given to employee referrals. 0:56 Um, this is a staggering statistic, but it's been found true over the years that the most common way that someone is getting a job offer and getting those interviews is by way of being referred to the company. 1:11 So the one of the most highest leverage things you can do is to get referred. So why is it so high? 1:17 Hiring someone for a job on a product or engineering team is a big deal. Um, especially if it's the team's product manager. 1:24 And why is this? It's because the PM is that one person on the team that is driving forward the roadmap and execution. 1:31 So if the company hires someone bad, their product is not going to grow and improve. And so how does that translate to referrals being 85% of job offers? 1:41 Well, companies are looking for people that they can trust in that role. And what is more trustworthy than one of their existing employees? 1:49 No, you know, vouching for someone and saying that they already know someone and referring them. Nothing. Um, so companies don't want to waste their time or resources on candidates who won't pan out. 2:01 So they strongly prefer interviewing people who are pre-vetted in some way, whether it is a direct one-to-one connection that you have with the contact, or if it's someone that you've had a call with or networked with. 2:14 Um, there's this level of, okay, you know, one of my employees that I've already hired, you know, this is the company speaking, one of my employees has already vetted this person in some way. 2:24 They've, you know, taken a look at their portfolio, or they've talked with them over the phone, they've answered questions over email, they've pre-vetted them in some way, and so there's a higher, you know, chance that I'm going to give this person a shot. 2:39 Um, the next, culture and job fit. So employees are also, um, going to only refer candidates that they think would actually be good for the job. 2:47 They know the job, they know the candidate, and so they can make a determination if it makes sense to actually push this person through the referral process. 2:55 And then finally, and pull up for this slide employee referral incentives. So tech companies are typically offering big referral bonuses to their employee base for referring candidates once they actually get hired and then usually once they stay for like three to six months. 3:10 But these bonuses can be two to five thousand times ten thousand for high level positions. So employees are financially incentivized also to refer candidates that will actually get the offer. 3:22 So even if you don't know someone first hand, if you impress them and they think you've got a shot at landing the offer that you land in the offer, you'll probably get a referral from them because they do have this financial incentive. 3:36 So that's one thing to keep in mind as you network, especially if you're nervous networking, you know, keep in mind that the people that you're networking with if they refer you, they're going to get paid a big. 3:46 Very big check typically for referring you to the role. So, what does a referral get you? So number one, it guarantees that someone is actually going to consider your application. 3:57 It bumps your, you know, imagine hundreds of people are applying for this one job. It guarantees that, you know, if someone's being referred, they're going to jump to the top of the list and actually be reviewed. 4:08 Um, it holds a heavy weight during the actual review process. Um, and it also speeds up the process for someone reviewing your application, which could sometimes take weeks down to days or sometimes hours. 4:20 So I've seen at companies I've been at when I refer a candidate, they're getting reviewed very, very quickly. Um, versus someone who's just applying straight to the job description, you know, they, they may hear back three weeks from the day they apply. 4:34 Um, these are a couple of the benefits of being referred. I hope in this lesson you, um, were able to understand and learn the actual importance of being referred and getting those referrals. 4:46 As it relates to you ultimately getting interviews and then the offer. Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to leverage networking to secure employee referrals so you can get your applications prioritized and increase your chances of interviews and job offers.,8291bb38-5ec1-4c83-9a8f-3dc74eaead63,97af8b40-4452-4c7e-9fca-e67818a7fc98,Importance of Networking,1,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:22.547194+00
7422302ccd4a4fedbd262eeb424fc543,"0:01 In this lesson I'm going over what to say when you actually reach out after you've identified the contact. So first I want to go over some quick tips. 0:10 Number one, customization is extremely important when you actually reach out to your contact within the company. Why? It's because they get dozens of these types of messages every single month. 0:21 And you need to stand out from the crowd to get a chance at a phone call or an email exchange and ultimately a referral and then interview. 0:30 Um, why won't they respond if it isn't customized? There's two main reasons. One, they are extremely busy. If you imagine a product manager at a company or, you know, a senior product manager or a director or any type of product manager, they're dealing with a number of different things, whether it's 0:46 bugs, bug reports, whether it's a new launch, whether it's a ton of meetings, whether it's planning for the next quarter. 0:53 There's so many different things that are happening on a product manager's plate. If they get a message where it isn't really customized and it's just copy and paste, there's really no reason that they would spend time out of their very busy day responding they don't know if it's worth even looking at 1:24 your profile they may not even click on to it so because of this it's to counteract both of these you need to customize the message and make it personal and make it interesting so they're actually is a chance that they respond so to go a little bit deeper on this imagine a context mindset after they 1:44 receive this message hey Anthony I'm a PM at Airbnb and I'm interested in growth therapy would you mind connecting so I can get feedback on the on the company the immediate kind of negative reaction that someone could have for this is yeah and so are a hundred other candidates they're also interested 2:02 or you know I'm extremely busy this week this isn't worth my time or got get feedback I mean what feedback do you need to get before you decide to apply you know these are some reactions that someone could have so with this in mind it's important that you actually customize the message and really really 2:23 deliver in a way that makes it seem um, you know like you're not desperate or demanding and um, you're, you're really trying to just authentically connect and you could provide value to them, you're unique, you have this portfolio and so I just linked to the product portfolio networking scripts and I 2:41 also go over these scripts in the product portfolio module because it's really important that you leverage your product portfolio when you reach out. 2:50 Um, so I don't go too in depth here, um, but I just wanted to highlight that this doc is really helpful because it has these scripts that you can use and put into, put into your um, uh, LinkedIn message, but there's things that you need to fill in. 3:04 So, for example, this one is reaching out to someone with no connections, this is reaching out to someone with mutual connections, and then this is reaching out to someone where you have a first connection with. 3:13 Um, so you're directly connected, and um, down below there are sections where you can fill in. Um, the main one here is interesting thing. 3:23 So, hey, you know, John, I hope you don't mind me reaching out. I'm interested in growth therapy and came across your profile. 3:29 Saw you did blank. Um, it's gonna be a number of different things. Saw you wrote a blog post about leveraging analytics and decision making. 3:37 I thought it was super interesting. Saw you transitioned into from sales into product. I thought that was super interesting. Saw you used to work in the entertainment. 3:54 It's not really that time intensive, but it shows that you did research. Um, and then you go into, would you be willing to answer a couple of questions? 4:02 I have a question for you. I'm happy to set up a short call, make it easy for them or send questions and then, oh, by the way, if you want to check out some past work, here's my site and then link to your portfolio. 4:12 Now, what is even better is if you are able to do a case study on an industry that you're interested in. 4:18 Applying to like healthcare. And if you're reaching out to a contact, a product manager at a health tech company, you could say, by the way, I put together this case study on, you know, um, using AI within the health tech space thought it would be interesting. 4:34 For you, um, and you would link directly to the case study that is like so far ahead of other candidates in terms of what they're actually putting in their messages that the chances that you get a response are significantly increased. 4:50 So, um, definitely check out the, uh, other tutorials and lessons within the product portfolio section, uh, but I just wanted to put this quick lesson together to let you know of this, this page and this resource and then to look forward to that when you actually are able to build out your product portfolio 5:06 .

They actually responded on LinkedIn. Um, you've set up time to chat with them for 15 minutes or 30 minutes. 00:14 What do you say on this call? So this is an overview. You're going to spend about two minutes at the right of the beginning of the call, you know, with some banter and thanking them. 00:24 Then 30 seconds is going to be spent delivering the purpose of this call. Then four minutes, you're going to go over quick introductions on both sides. 00:32 20 minutes you're going to spend with questions, questions that you've come up and that you're asking the contact that you have. 00:39 They're going to spend one minute at the end expressing interest, then covering next steps and then finally thanking them, remembering to thank them at the end. 00:48 adds up to, you know, about 30 minute call and these are not hard, like, um, and, and, and really strict time amounts of time, but it's generally a framework that I like to stick to when I'm doing these calls to make sure that it's productive. 01:01 It's hitting all the right things. Um, and we have good next steps coming out. So the first one, banter and thank them. 01:09 So at the beginning of the call, you're going to have some small talk and banter like, oh, where are you based out of? 01:14 Where are you calling from? Or, you know, um, uh, something about the weather, some basic banter that you would have on any call when you're calling. You're meeting someone new. 01:22 Uh, but it's really to break the ice and just get things going. Um, then you're going to want to thank them for taking the time to speak with you. 01:28 So consider the context. You may be and probably are a random person to them and they have decided to give you a chance and spend their valuable time. 01:37 I'm speaking with you in the previous lesson. I went over all the things that could be happening within a product manager's day. 01:42 They may literally have seven other meetings that day. They may have an interview right after the, you know, they may be interviewing a candidate right after the, uh, you talk to them. 01:51 They may be doing a kickoff. You know, there's so many things that may be happening within their day and they have taken time out of it to speak with you. 02:00 Um, so, uh, you know, this to them is just another distraction ultimately to what they need to get done, but they still took the time. 02:08 So with that in mind, make sure to acknowledge this and thank them and they will be in a better mood because of it. 02:14 Um, you know, you could say something like, before we get started, I just wanted to really thank you for taking the time out of your day to speak with me. 02:20 I can imagine how busy you are in your role at Airbnb. So I do really appreciate it. And they, you know, they will listen to this and really take it in and you're going to, you know, you're going to have a great starting point for your conversation. 02:34 So next up is purpose. You're going to want to state, why are we on this call? What is the purpose? 02:39 Why are we speaking? Set the context and pay attention. And, you know, really deliver what led us to this moment. 02:46 So you could say something like, like I mentioned in my LinkedIn message, I'm really considering new roles in product and Airbnb caught my eye. 02:55 I really wanted to learn more about your experience on a team. Um, and some of the challenges you've worked on to get a better sense of, you know, how, what it's like to work there. 03:03 Um, I figured we could start with some quick intros and then I did have a couple questions for you. Does that sound good? 03:08 So, um, it's really, really bad when you're networking with someone and um, you're not really leading the call and you're, you're putting it on the contact. 03:18 This is always an awful place to be in because the contact is not the one who should be driving the call. 03:24 They should not be taking charge. Um, and if they, they are, it probably means that they felt like they needed to. 03:31 And so by, by, you know, centering around this and saying, I figured we could start with quick intros. And then I did have a couple questions for you. 03:37 Does that sound good? You're stating the purpose, what, you know, the agenda will look like for this call and then checking with them to make sure that they're aligned with that. 03:46 purpose. Next, you're going to go into intros. So you're going to give a 30 to 60 second elevator pitch. Um, it should be succinct, engaging and tailored to the context. 03:57 So begin by briefly introducing yourself, including your career trajectory and what your call is. Um, briefly explain your, uh, current company if you feel it's necessary, but you don't need to spend a lot of time there because they're not really that interested. 04:12 Um, and then you want to mention your aspirations for transitioning into a product management role. Um, and then end with a question for them. 04:22 Turn it back on them. So how about yourself? We'd love to hear a bit about how you ended up, uh, at Airbnb. 04:27 The goal here is to be short but descriptive so they have an understanding of who you are, you know, what led us to this point, et cetera. 04:34 So. Um, you know, after you say, you know, I figured we could start with some quick intros and then I did have a couple questions. 04:40 Does that sound good? They're going to say, yeah, that sounds good to me. You could say, great. So I've always been really interested in tech. 04:47 I started out after college as an account manager at a B2B. Firm. I realized that I was gravitating towards the analytics side. 04:55 So I actually ended up transitioning into a product analytics role at, you know, company ABC and working as an analyst. 05:02 I've been able to drive a ton of insights from my team. I learned that I'd love to take those insights and actually build on top of them. 05:09 And that's really now why I'm excited about the possibility of transitioning into a PM role. How about yourself? Would love to hear a bit about how you ended up in your product position. 05:20 And then they're going to give, you know, their 60 second or two minute, story. Um, but what you get from this short description is, okay. 05:28 I mean, this contact now has a better understanding of your trajectory, but you didn't have to dive really deep into everything. 05:35 Like my company does this type of sales for them. It's like, ultimately the net, the contact doesn't really matter or care about that. 05:44 They just want to know like, what, what is the, what is your vibe? What is your trajectory? What is bringing you to this moment? 05:51 So the next section is questions. So now that you've both both introduced yourself, it's time to ask those questions. Um, you're going to have a set of prepared questions and it's really important that you actually do prepare those questions, um, to learn as much as possible about them, the role and 06:08 the company. You should spend a lot of time mapping interesting and engaging questions. They hate, contacts hate to be asked basic questions that can be answered online with a little bit of research or that are just very service level. 06:22 But they love to be asked interesting, specific, nuanced questions that require them to think and um, can sound intelligent answering. 06:30 Um, people like to hear themselves talk. They, they like to be challenged and you know, when they're delivering something, they, they want to feel as though they're delivering, you know, a smart take, um, or providing value. 06:42 And so by, kind of giving them those questions that are interesting and unique and specific. You are laying the foundation for, you're, you're, you're giving them the opportunity to do that. 06:53 So your questions should generally cover them, their background, uh, the company, and then the role. A couple specific questions that you could ask, um, for your candidate conversations, or sorry, your networking conversations. 07:07 Um, quote, I saw that you transitioned from a customer support role to a PM role about three years ago. I'd love to hear like, what were your biggest learnings from that transition? 07:16 Okay, I mean, this is clear. You've looked into their background. You're asking something specific. Next, you could ask the question. 07:24 I was reading a bunch of reviews of your messaging product. It seems like users are really interested in API functionality to mark messages as read or unread. 07:32 Similar to what Apple announced last year. I'm curious, like, how does your team evaluate and prioritize feature requests like that? 07:40 This is a very specific question. It took a lot of research to put together, um, but it shows that you care. 07:47 You're actually interested. And like, what is it like to work on your team in terms of how you guys think about prioritization? 07:52 Next, what's one of the most challenges? Uh, what, what is one of the most challenging projects you've worked on in the last couple of months? 07:58 Now, this isn't really like specific or requires research, but it's one of those questions that you can have in your back pocket, um, and you should have a lot of follow-up questions when the candidate, or they, when the person answers this question. 08:12 And then, um, finally, would you be able to explain what you know about the orders team? Um, I'd love to understand where they fit within the overall customer journey in the team. 08:20 This is actually going to give you a lot of information and insights into the role that you want to apply for. 08:26 You can ask different questions as follow-ups, uh, but these are a couple different example questions that generally get the ball rolling and show that you're really interested in this person and the role. 08:43 Okay, now we've gotten to the end of the networking call and you want to express interest. So by this point you've hopefully impressed them, um, you know, by the questions that you asked. 08:57 They were intelligent, they were well researched and you impressed the networking contact. Um, you've listened carefully and you've asked follow-up questions where applicable and now you should express your interest in applying for the specific role. 09:12 So you could say, well, this has been incredibly helpful. Um, it's been really interesting learning at a deeper level how you guys really operate and it definitely got me excited about the role. 09:22 Um, I think it aligns with my skill set, my background. And my interests and so I'm going to definitely go ahead and apply for the role. 09:29 And depending on how they respond, if it feels right, you may be able to ask them directly for a referral over the call. 09:37 Um, you could say something along the lines of after this conversation, would you feel comfortable? Well, referring me for this role, I think it can be a great fit for what they're looking for. 09:46 No pressure either way though, this has been super informative for me. Um, then you're now at the end of the call. 09:53 Depending on what they say, there's a couple different options here, but it's time to establish these clear next steps. So you should express what you and your contact will be doing. 10:01 So, um, for example, if you want, if you're going to be going ahead and applying directly, you could say, this all sounds great. 10:08 I'm definitely gonna go ahead and apply directly for the role. Um, if you're interested, would you want me to keep you up to date with the application? 10:14 They'll probably say yes. Um, if they said to you that they're going to refer you, um, you could say, thank you so much for your willingness to refer me. 10:22 I'd be happy to send any materials that would be helpful, um, to your email after that, uh, after this. Does your email work for me to send that to? 10:31 And they'll say like, yeah, sure, that's fine. And then finally, staying in touch for future opportunities. Maybe there isn't a job that, uh, is active right now, but you still want its network. 10:39 Today, this has been super helpful. I'd love to stay in touch with you about any future openings on the team. 10:45 Sounds like an awesome. Place to work and it really aligns closely with my skill set. And then they'll say, yeah, of course, like would love to stay in touch. 10:52 And then at the very end of the call, you want to make sure to go out of your way to thank them again for taking the time to chat. 10:59 It's helpful to leave on a positive note because they're going to For more information visit www.fema.gov Remember this last thing that you say to them. 11:04 So you could, you know, right at the end, you could say, Hey, Jake, this has been a really enjoyable conversation. 11:09 I learned a ton about Airbnb and it was really interesting hearing about your background and your story as well. Congrats on all of your success so far. 11:18 Um, thank you so much for chatting again and I'm excited to send you over my resume or I'm excited to stay in touch or I'm excited to apply for this role. 11:26 Have a great day and then you'll, you'll end the call there. Um, so this is generally how you should structure your networking call. 11:34 Um, hopefully you can stick to these overall points. Um, and then in the, in the next lesson, you were going to go over how to actually win your contact over in this call. 11:44 So different tips and tricks that you can deploy, um, to really be as effective as possible. So I'll see you there.","Learn how to structure and lead a networking call with purpose, introductions, targeted questions, and next steps so you can secure referrals and move your application forward.",1fb92cad-ba0d-42be-b466-730f273cbf67,97af8b40-4452-4c7e-9fca-e67818a7fc98,What to say on the call,3,TRUE,12,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:23.611983+00
d18ead41805f41b0bc61ac490eac8833,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over different tactics you can use to win your contact over. So, number one, be grateful, excited, and passionate. 00:09 People you network with are going to be stressed from their day. And if you add some positive energy to the day, they're going to be grateful for it. 00:16 They want you to also be really interested in listening to them and learning about the company. So be genuine. You should care because this could be your future employer. 00:27 So always remember that. People want you to be passionate about the industry, company, and role. People want to help people who come off as really energetic and passionate. 00:36 So if you are genuinely like excited for the answers that they're talking about and you're getting the, you know, if they can look at you and see the wheels in your head turning, they're gonna be a lot more excited about this conversation. 00:48 They, they don't want to talk to someone who's just going through the motions like, so, um, yeah, could you tell me about, um, you know, the number of engineers on your team? 01:01 That is, it's too basic, too surface level. Show passion. If you can go into this call and, and say something like, you know, mental health means so much to me. 01:12 Um, you know, my family has a history of struggling with mental health. And so, you know, I've seen the, the power of therapy with my family. 01:21 And historically, it's been such a challenge, um, when they're trying to find a new therapist. And I think it's really incredible the work that you're doing and your team is doing to make this easier. 01:32 And um, you know, and then answer your question. So just demonstrate your question. and excited about this conversation and that that energy is going to be feeding back and forth between you and the person. 01:44 Next, you want to find common ground and common interests. So, try to identify beforehand or during the call different aspects about you to that are in common. ive been like try to research these before the call or um, you know, if it comes up naturally in conversation during the call, um, that would 02:32 be great as well. So, um, the way you can do this is check their LinkedIn, check company profiles, check their social media, you know, try to find stuff about them you could organically bring up in the conversation. 02:44 Um, you could share personal anecdotes that relate to what you're saying. So, oh, that's super cool. I remember doing XYZ three years ago is such a interesting experience. 02:53 And just, you know, saying things like that, bringing up those personal connections and, you know, um, things that relate to them. 03:01 It's going to help build the bond that you have with this contact. Um, next, consider being vulnerable, vulnerable, excuse me, and very honest. 03:10 So showing vulnerability like sharing challenges you're facing. Humanize you and make you more relatable. You don't want to appear or sound desperate. 03:18 So this is like a fine line, but you know, share personal stories or challenges, but keep it relevant and professional. 03:25 Um, so you could talk about how you've really been interested in transitioning into a product role within your company. But you know, they didn't have enough resourcing, which has been quite challenging. 03:34 Um, but now you're seeking, you know, another opportunity elsewhere. Um, you know, them hearing this, they're going to feel, you know, empathy and they're going to want to help. 03:44 Um, admit when you don't know something. Also, and express a keenness to learn that thing. So if they're talking about something and you know, they use it in an abbreviation or something and you genuinely don't know what it is, it would be much better to upfront say, Oh, you know, I've actually never 04:00 heard of, um, testing. Could you actually explain a little bit more about that? Now, hopefully you get from the lessons, uh, within this overall program, you understand AB testing, but it's an example of the type of thing where you don't want to, you know, go continue to go on in the conversation without 04:16 knowing what they're talking about. So bring it up and ask a question. Be honest about where you're at and match that with a passion to learn and improve. 04:25 Like, remember how much you actually want this. Next, ask, acknowledge if you can help them. People are more willing to help if they've, uh, if they feel you've offered them something in return. 04:36 Even if it's just a valuable insight or a fresh perspective. So sharing a valuable article, event, or insight related to their industry could be helpful. 04:45 Try to avoid bringing something up if it's very likely they already know about it and you wouldn't be able to talk about it. 04:50 In a more intelligent or knowledgeable way. Um, this could make you look bad. So for example, um, you know, if you're networking with someone at Spotify and you saw an article about, you know, a new, uh, law and it, that is passing around music streaming and it's been huge. 05:07 News coverage and there's been a lot of talk about it. It's likely they know more about it than you do. 05:14 And so, you know, bringing it up isn't really going to get you too far with it. Um, and so it might not make sense in that way. 05:23 There's something else random and you could think of an article, you could say, oh, that, you know, that reminds me of an article that I read that was really interesting. 05:31 Um, I'll have to send it to you after this call. You might find it valuable. And then that's a great excuse to email them after within the thank you note and send that link. 05:39 To the article. Another option would be to offer to introduce them to someone who might be beneficial for them. So, you know, maybe you have some contact within some industry that they're, you know, doing work within. 05:51 So it could be helpful if you can make a connection. And so there's these couple of things that you can offer if it comes up organically within the call. 05:59 Um, so play it by ear and see what happens. Um, next, actively listen, ingest, and follow up. So people, again, are going to feed off of your energy in the conversation. 06:10 If you sound hungry to learn. They're going to be wanting to share more. They're going to be willing to talk and ultimately refer you to really take in what they're saying like try to learn it deeply. 06:22 Don't just ask questions and then sit there like um, you know, you're not really paying attention like. Really pay attention to the answers that they are giving you. 06:30 And if you have questions about something, ask it. Um, as long as it wouldn't be annoying like don't continue to interrogate them for everything they're saying. 06:38 Um, but like genuinely follow up like when they're telling you a story. free. Ask a follow-up question demonstrating that you were listening intently to what they were saying. 06:50 Um, you know, the best way to show that you're actively listening is to ask interesting follow-ups. This is the same in dating, for example. 06:57 Um, you don't just want to ask a surfer. You want to, you know, whatever their answer is, you want them to know like you are actively listening, ingesting, taking in what they're saying, trying to remember it, trying to process it, etc. 07:14 Next, mirror them. This technique and involves subtly mimicking the language or behavior of your contact. Um, it can create a sense of similarity and report. 07:23 Um, you want to use similar language or phrasing or a similar pace or tone in speech and also reflect their level of formality or enthusiasm. Next, compliment them. 08:02 So, people love hearing compliments. Share one that makes sense in weight things that you can compliment them on communication style previous work their energy you know a couple examples you can say like by the way I think you're an incredible writer your article has always intrigued me or you know your 08:23 perspective on that topic was really interesting um or you have a way with words that makes these really complex ideas easy to understand someone's in here then and and be like wow like that's I appreciate that but definitely don't force this it would come off really weird if you're forcing it um and 08:39 that could backfire so only you know if this if there is a moment where you think it makes sense and it would be natural for you to compliment them go ahead and do it make sure it's not weird or inappropriate probe. 08:52 Or you know about their physical appearance or anything like that. Um, it should really be around like their work, their communication, their perspective, their intelligence, stuff like that. 09:03 Um, next, remember conversational best practices. So, remember. Uh, like all these different things when it comes to talking to this person. 09:12 Number one, do not cut them off. That is a huge red flag. It pisses people off. Definitely don't cut them off as they're giving an answer and going through an answer. 09:23 So allow them to finish. It's without interruption. Next is maintain eye contact. Um, it, you know, conveys attentiveness and trustworthiness. 09:31 A lot of the time when I am, you know, interviewing people or networking and on a video call, like they will be looking at another screen. 09:41 Um, you know, from compared to the, uh, laptop or place where their camera is, this is really distracting and it just doesn't make the person feel like they're being listened to. 09:53 It looks like they're just doing something else. Maybe, you know, maybe the video is on that other screen, but like, you want to be like as close to looking in the camera as possible. 10:04 Um, so definitely try to do that during the call. Also avoid multitasking, um, at all costs. Like, give the conversation your undivided attention. 10:13 Put your phone down, turn off your notifications, like, close Slack, close Microsoft Teams, whatever tool you use, um, to, to message. 10:22 Like, turn all that off so you can focus like 100% on this conversation. Be mindful of body language so ensure that your posture is open and inviting. 10:32 Don't, you know, cross your arms, like, sit back. You want to, you know, appear interested, appear engaged. Next, ask open-ended questions. 10:42 Encourage the other person to share more by asking these questions. That can't be answered with a simple yes or no. 10:49 Be empathetic. So validate their feelings or viewpoints, even if you disagree with it. Show that you understand where they're coming from. 10:55 Stay present. You want to focus on the conversation and avoid letting your mind wander or thinking about your next question. 11:01 Um, it's kind of easy to tell when someone is just like in their head thinking about the next thing that they're going to say or like jump in it because it ends up being completely unrelated to the thing that you just said and so if you ask a question and then they answer and then you immediately jump 11:18 into a different, completely different question without acknowledging their answer, it just comes off as you were, as though you were like waiting for them to finish, um, and use how to script to run through. 11:30 Finally, be genuine, like be authentic in your responses and your reactions. Avoid giving a canned or insincere, uh, replies. Next, do research about the company. 11:41 You need to demonstrate that you actually, like, looked into the company, you know what they're about, and don't try to get by with a quick Google search, like 10 minutes before the call. 11:50 Look into the history of the company. Look into how their products evolved over time. So where did they start? You know, where did they start 3 years ago or 15 years ago? 12:00 What was their product like 10 years ago, 8 years ago, 6, etc.? What are the different products and feature sets look like? 12:08 What does it actually do? What problems is it solving for customers? Like how expensive is it? What is the pricing? 12:16 Is it subscription based? What are the different ways that you can customize your experience? Who are their competitors? Thanks for watching! See you next time! So who's operating there? 12:24 Who are the direct competitors and direct competitors? What are their customers saying about them? Like, is this product loved, liked, disliked? 12:32 What news articles were posted recently about them? There's so much that you can learn about a company by actually doing research. 12:38 And if you don't do this, you're just going to come off as someone who isn't really interested in this company or doesn't really care that much and no one wants to refer someone who doesn't seem to care about the world. 12:54 Like, people are going to be ultimately like, who you're networking with, these people are going to have to work with you and they're not going to want to work with someone who appears lazy or isn't interested in the actual company. 13:07 So make sure to do research and then come up with questions. Um, I kind of briefly went over this, but ask open-ended questions that are going to make them think. 13:19 So not the yes and no type questions. Um, you want to keep them open-ended. So the yes and no questions are super boring from their perspective, and also you don't get anything from there, really. 13:32 Like, if you ask a question like, um, you know, in general, we'd like, do you think the culture is good? 13:38 Like, yes or no? Um, I mean, this is, obviously they're gonna say yes. Yes. It's not really valuable. Um, but an open-ended question would be like, so like, what, you know, tell me what, what is the culture like at growth therapy? 13:53 And this is gonna have, you know, this is gonna force them to think like, okay, um, yeah, what is the culture? 13:58 How do we operate? Um, what are the values that we have? And they're gonna deliver a more, you know, interesting response, and you're gonna be able to riff off of it. 14:07 Um, so ask open-ended questions as, as much as possible. And then make sure they're structured in a way that enables your contact. 14:15 To think and deliver this answer. You don't want to ask, like, super confusing questions. Um, you know, you want a clear question to be answered that is gonna get them to think. 14:26 Next, send a thank-you note. So after the call, regardless of the next steps, you should always write a custom- randomized thank-you note and send it to them. 14:34 This should be sent, you know, between 30 minutes to 4 hours later. Definitely by the end of that, like, workday, you want to get this thank-you note in pretty quickly. 14:43 Um, you don't want it, like, right after the call because you just ended things, but, you know, wait 30 minutes and send it off. 14:49 And an example would be, hey Jake, I wanted to thank you again for chatting with me earlier today and your willingness to refer me. 14:55 Super interesting, learning more about CompanyABC, from their unique product releases recently to their process and what the future looks like. 15:03 Excited about the options? Let me know in the comments below. great to close the loop with your contact. 15:15 And then finally, remember that you are in control, not them. This is the call. You wanted, you set it up. 15:22 You want to lead it. Take charge of the conversation because they have to take charge of almost every other conversation that they have at work. 15:30 And so give them a break from this and take charge yourself. They want to see that. You know, you're confident. 15:37 You know what you're doing. You're a leader. You can ask questions and you're confident in the workplace. So, remember when you're doing these calls that you are in control, not them. 15:48 Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to build rapport and lead networking conversations using research, active listening, and thoughtful follow-ups so you can earn referrals and stronger professional connections.",0252d970-17f6-4f34-a5ba-f2d62cf9d12b,97af8b40-4452-4c7e-9fca-e67818a7fc98,How to win your contact over,4,TRUE,16,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:24.207657+00
2628154f54f94865a60a7871942424fe,"0:00 In this lesson, I wanted to go over communicating to your network that you are open for work. So number one here is to post on LinkedIn. 0:10 If you are in between jobs or you're a student, please feel free and empowered to make a post on LinkedIn and now you can do this multiple times because not everyone is notified. 0:22 and sees your posts. You never know who in your network or outside of your network will see the post, remember it, and connect you with someone who has an opening. 0:32 During the process, you need to get more eyeballs on you as a product management candidate. You know, if you're not posting anything, if you're not making a portfolio, if you're not updating your LinkedIn, if you're not saying you're open to search, like no one is gonna actually know that you're interested 0:48 in making a portfolio. Becoming a product manager, you have to kind of publicize this. 0:51 You need to get out there, get out into the world and try to announce this, um, so that people know, um, in your post announce that you're looking for a PM role, why you're interested in transitioning, maybe include a personal story. 1:05 And then have a call to action for people in your network to connect you with others. So you might say, as some of you may know, I'm currently open to work and searching for a PM role. 1:14 After four years working as a data analyst, I'm eager to get closer to the center of product development. I'm excited to leverage my data. 1:21 Data skillset in my next role. I'm primarily looking for roles in the health tech industry, but open to other industries as well. 1:27 If anyone knows someone in their network who would be helpful to chat with, I'd love to be connected. Thank you in advance. 1:32 And using these hashtags, you can even say like, um, hashtag. Uh, health tech, you know, use these hashtags and then LinkedIn is going to promote your post and just it'll appear in other places as well. 1:46 So this is a great tool. Um, you don't have to do this once again, you can do this multiple times. 1:50 You know, I've seen people who will post several times. Um, even some people will have their posts go viral, um, and, and have like tens of thousands of people see and then people are willing to comment. 2:02 Um, you know, I've had people post, you know, uh, or, or like my posts, if people like your posts, you can always reach out. 2:09 To them. So posting on LinkedIn is a great way to just start to get it out there into the universe that you're interested in transitioning into product. 2:17 Next, tell your friends and family. This includes like old coworkers, whatever. Make sure everyone knows that you're looking for a PM job. 2:25 So bring it up at gatherings, meetups, parties, anything that you're doing in your daily life. Make sure that everyone knows that you're interested in becoming a product manager. 2:36 Um, it's why leverage your biggest organic and existing network. These are your friends, family, everyone. You currently know. Um, and you never know like who knows who and what. 2:46 Um, as mentioned, employee referrals account for 85% of job offers. People give people jobs. And so if you can leverage this big network that you already have, um, you never know it could be a, you know, your cousin knows someone who is a product manager and can connect you. 3:02 Um, you know, your mom's friend's son, his girlfriend is a product manager and that can, you know, be a connection for you. 3:11 So you never know, um, you know, who's going to be the one who's going to help you, but just started to start to get it out into the world. 3:18 Um, start to connect with people, um, by way of your existing network. Um, and then finally publicize in other ways that you're open to work. 3:25 So a couple of different examples, networking events, you could go to networking events. You know, go up to people say, Hey, like I'm, I'm, you know, I've been an analyst, but I'm trying to become a product manager. 3:35 Like, you know, I'd love to get your LinkedIn and stay in touch alumni networks. This is really, really great. So if you have an alumni network, you know, just go into LinkedIn search for your college. 3:46 Search for the keyword product and network with anyone within there. You never know the connections that they may have and may connect you to different professional groups. 3:56 So there's different groups on LinkedIn or Facebook for product managers, um, industry events, um, you could volunteer, uh, you could meet, you know, volunteer for anything. 4:07 Um, whether it's like literally, you know, the last one and an athletic, um, volunteer on an athletic team, you could volunteer, you know, in a shelter and you never know who you're going to meet. 4:18 Always people out there with connections. Everyone in, you know, if you think of like a network, social network, um, if you've seen those types of like graphs and charts, you know, one person in has like a bunch of these people around them that they're connected to. 4:33 And as soon as you connect with that person, it's immediately like, okay, your, your entire network has expanded to also include those people. 4:42 If, if you have a strong connection to that person and they're willing to help you out. Chances are someone knows someone that can put you in touch with a product person and any connection is in a help. 4:55 Um, whether it's for you to learn more and, you know, continue learning the lingo or be connected and actually re be referred to a job, anything is going to help. 5:03 So hopefully this helped you understand the different ways you can actually. Get out into the world that you are open to work as a product manager.",Learn how to announce you’re open to product manager roles through LinkedIn posts and networking so you can increase visibility and referrals for job opportunities.,916786e0-2d94-4761-8f41-90a5575ac5db,97af8b40-4452-4c7e-9fca-e67818a7fc98,Communicating to your network,5,TRUE,6,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:24.655067+00
5308f1a1ed9747faa6b7099b1a5f9b00,"00:01 Welcome to lesson 1.2 and this lesson we're going to go over the importance of PMs in organization So by the end of this lesson you're going to have a clear understanding of why Product Management is really important and vital to a business, a tech company or any company in general being successful 00:19 how the PM plays a major part in contributing to the overall business achieving its goals and also helping the company meet the customer needs okay, so the value of of product management. 00:32 Number one, a lining product with business goals. One of the primary reasons that PMs exist and product management is really important is that we make sure that the ultimate experience with the software is actually aligning to the business goals. 00:47 What are those goals? We need to understand what they are and make sure that the software that we're building, the features that we're building, actually align to it. 00:56 Number two here, product managers work super closely with a bunch of different teams and stakeholders to develop a product vision and strategy that is supporting this company's overall objectives. 01:09 And then lastly here, by defining and communicating this vision and strategy out to all these different stakeholders, PMs are really able to keep the entire company focused on delivering products that really drive success for the business. 01:25 Okay so number two here is understanding the customer needs. Product management, aka product managers, they're playing a really crucial role in understanding what does the customer need at the end of the day and then translating that into successful products. 01:45 It's very easy to say oh I think we should build this feature or I think we should build this feature but that doesn't mean much if if it's not actually solving a problem that a customer is actually experiencing. 01:57 What you'll learn in the role of a product manager is that users don't just go onto software for fun and just click around. 02:06 They're going to it to achieve some specific thing that could be entertainment, it could be a tool, but they're going to the product to accomplish something. 02:17 And you need to make sure that the features that your team is responsible for are actually facilitating the user achieving that goal. 02:25 You can do this through a bunch of different methods. So user research is a big one, data analysis, looking through customer feedback. 02:32 PMs are really able to identify across all these different inputs, the pain points of users, what their desires are, and what trends exists, and that should inform the product development process. 02:45 Okay, keeping a really strong focus on what the users actually need, PMs are able to help ensure that the products that are being designed for a company are actually solving problems and creating value for users. 02:59 Value for users ultimately results in revenue for the company. Okay, so the next one is around prioritization. This is probably one of the most important things that a PM could do because within a company there's always limited resources. 03:15 You don't have unlimited engineers, unlimited designers, unlimited marketers, etc, to work on your product. You may have five to eight engineers at a given time. 03:26 You may have one designer. So you want to make sure that everything that the team is actually working on is extremely important and it's going to deliver a lot of value to the user. 03:37 So it's the PM's role and product management in general to evaluate potential projects based on their impact and also other inputs, like how long will it project take, how complex it is, et cetera. 03:50 So by prioritizing the right features and work that delivers the most value, PMs are able to make sure that organizations are getting the most out of the people they hire. 04:01 Typically in a company, almost always, the employees are the biggest cost. So you could have an engineering team where everyone's making $150,000. 04:10 Your entire team may cost the company a million dollars per year. And when the company is looking at that, they're saying, okay, we have this team. 04:18 It's costing us a million dollars a year to actually have this team. What is the return on investment? How much is that team actually generating for the company? 04:28 And if they're not contributing in a major way to the company's bottom line at the end of the day, they may say, okay, we're not actually sure why this team exists. 04:37 So it's the PM's role to make sure that you're actually working on the right stuff that delivers enough value to users to actually improve the business's bottom line, whether that's earning more revenue, whether that's saving costs, streamlining, et cetera, that's the PM's role. 04:56 The next is driving cross-functional collaboration. So PMs are really, again, they're a bridge between a bunch of different teams within an organization. 05:05 Engineering design are the ones that they collaborate most closely with on a day-to-day basis, but marketing is also a huge component. 05:13 There has to be a cohesive strategy between how we're marketing the product and what the product actually ends up being. 05:20 So if there's a campaign on a social media ad, there needs to be a collaboration so that we know that when a user who's just out out in the world, they may be on Instagram, TikTok, when they open an ad and then and come to the product, it's gonna work seamlessly. 05:36 It's gonna make sense. They're gonna be able to sign up really easily. So marketing and product collaborates really closely. Sales, you know B2B organization when you're working primarily with businesses, it is really important as well. 05:51 Those teams need to be aligned because the sales organization may be promising features to potential customers and talking about the nuances of a product. 06:01 And the PMs are the subject matter experts in the actual product. So the sales team and the PMs are going to work really closely together to make sure that potential prospects for the business, for the B2B, these customers are going to understand what's going on, their needs are going to be met, etc 06:19 . So the PMs really coordinate cross functionally to ensure that all the teams are working together and they have shared goals. 06:28 It's really important to maintain alignment, streamline communication, and foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. So you do want all these people working together. 06:39 You do want to hear their ideas, so you can use them, take them as inputs, and ultimately deliver a great product. 06:46 So the next one here, making data driven decisions. So in today's competitive business landscape organizations really need to make data driven of indecisions to stay ahead of the curve. 06:58 So what this means is you're able to track a lot of data from a product experience. You're able to tell where people are coming from, if they're signing up, different attributes about the customer, if they're completing the onboarding experience, if they're engaging with particular features, and you're 07:17 gonna wanna take all these different data inputs and make decisions based off of them. So for example, if you see that out of a hundred people who land on the landing page of your website, only 10% are even clicking to sign up. 07:32 That means 90% of your potential is lost immediately because people are even clicking to sign up. You could see that when they do click to sign up, that 85% of them actually do make an account, and that's really good. 07:46 So if you're looking at those two data points, you're going to say, okay, our biggest opportunity here, the place that we're losing the most customers is just getting people to click the signup button. 07:58 So we need to make changes on our landing page to drive more people, a lot more people to actually click to sign up. 08:04 And the PM is really responsible for playing this role within a team. They're trying to collect this data, they're analyzing it, they may work with a product analyst or a data analyst, but it's really on them to think about this, think about this data, how to get it, how to analyze it, and then how 08:24 to make decisions based off of it. And those decisions are really going to funnel into the roadmap, the overall strategy, to make sure that your product can stay competitive in the market. 08:35 So I want to just quickly go over two different scenarios to highlight the importance of a PM in an organization. 08:43 And so the first scenario is in a focus on a company that just does not have a product manager and then the second is an example where a PM is really instrumental in growth of the company. 08:53 So the first example, no product manager. Imagine a small company that's developing a project management tool like Monday.com Trello but it's focused on remote teams. 09:04 Without a designated PM, the team is really relying on a mix of inputs from the engineers, designers and the CEO to guide the product development process. 09:14 It doesn't sound too bad, does it? But as the result of not having a dedicated PM, number one, the team is struggling to align on what product features the company should actually build that reach their overall goal and target market. 09:29 The engineering team is really wanting to focus on building very advanced features that they find interesting to build, but might not be relevant to the core needs of remote teams. 09:40 This is very, very common. Engineers will typically want to work on making something, do something in a very specific way that may be good for their workflow, but it may not be good for the actual end customer. 09:53 The second one, the company may fail to conduct proper user research and gather customer feedback. So the ultimate product that is delivered for these remote teams really doesn't address any of the pain points and desires of this market. 10:06 It may be good for in-person teams but it just doesn't do anything for remote teams. Number three, without a clear system and way of prioritizing features, the team spent a lot of time on low impact initiatives, and high value features were either delayed or never developed to begin with. 10:24 So what ended up happening is the team just did all these little tweaks here and there, but none of them really actually made a huge impact on the users or the business. 10:35 And then number four, finally, the lack of central coordination for cross functional collaboration leads to communication breakdowns, duplicated efforts, and an overall disjointed product experience. 10:48 So this means that, you know, maybe two engineers were actually working on the same thing at the same time, wasted resources, or a disjointed product experience. 10:57 No one was really thinking holistically about the user journey from beginning to end, like, how is a user getting from sign up to purchasing to actually finding success in the product and it's just just joined it overall. 11:09 So this was like just a little example of what could potentially happen if a team didn't have a product manager and didn't have them a person, single person focused on all this stuff. 11:20 So the ultimate outcome here, the product did not align with the company's goals. It didn't meet any of the customer needs and the team really suffered from poor collaboration and prioritization. 11:32 So, the company, you know, the result of this is that this example company struggled to get great gain traction in the market and they eventually had to pivot or ultimately shut down. 11:44 So, to show and demonstrate the opposite effect, we're going to consider another example where a PM is really instrumental in the growth of a company. 11:53 So, this startup is focused on an AI-powered language learning app. They bring on an experienced PM early in the development process and the PM really takes charge of shaping the vision and strategy, ensuring that it aligns with what the company is trying to do, which is to make language learning accessible 12:13 and enjoyable for everyone. Okay, so as a result of having a dedicated PM on the team, number one, the PM actually conducted thorough user research to understand the needs and preferences of language learners. 12:25 And they also identified key features that would actually set their app apart from other competitors. Since there's a lot of language learning apps out there, they needed to know and identify what are the things that are going to make a difference and get people users out there to go to our app instead 12:41 of the existing competitors. Number two, they worked really closely with the engineering and design teams, and they insured that the apps AI-driven personalization and gamification features were developed really well and in line with the ultimate product vision. 12:56 Number three, the product manager made sure that they prioritized features based on the actual impact on the user engagement metrics and retention metrics. 13:06 And this really focused the team's efforts on initiatives that actually drive the most value. So again, we're going back to the return and return on investment of your engineering team. 13:15 The PM made sure that the teams initiatives, what they were actually working on, were really good for the overall business. 13:22 And then finally by coordinating cross-functional collaboration and communication, the PM really fostered a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. So the team was able to iterate and refine the app based on user feedback and data insights. 13:36 This is the ideal end state where the team is really like a well-oiled machine, continuously improving the product over time, continually making the users happier and happier. 13:48 The ultimate outcome is that thanks to the product manager on this team, the language learning app became a major success. 13:56 It got millions of downloads, millions of users, and it really disrupted the existing market. It changed how it is to actually learn a new language. 14:05 The company experienced rapid growth, and they actually were able to secure an additional round of funding to expand its product offering and even reach new markets. 14:16 So that's a little bit about the difference between what could happen on a team that doesn't have a PM versus what happens on a team that does have a PM. 14:25 So hopefully from this lesson you understand the importance of a PM in an organization. Again, they are really, really critical to the success of the overall product between working with a bunch of different stakeholders, defining the vision, the roadmap, using data alongside all of these processes. 14:42 The PM is really responsible for making sure that their feature set, their product area is successful, solving user problems and good for the overall business. 14:52 Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to explain why product managers are essential for aligning products with business goals and customer needs so you can justify PM roles and decisions.,7560d00a-27bb-40f8-8bf2-01fadd0ceb63,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Importance of PMs in Organizations,1.2,TRUE,15,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:20.234339+00
3a1aa1f6a9c24e1792af0024cdccbc44,"00:00 Welcome to lesson 1.3. In this lesson, we're going to go over what a product manager does versus what a project manager does. 00:08 So we're going to explore what are the actual differences between these roles. There are sometimes two distinct roles that are confused between each other within organizations. 00:20 There's actually crossover. There may not be a project manager on a team and it's just the product manager. And they have to take on their roles and responsibilities of the project manager. 00:30 So every company does it a little bit differently. But if there are two distinct roles at a company, this video and this lesson will explain a little bit more into the clear responsibility. 00:43 So to dive in here, on the left side we have product managers and on the right we have project managers. 00:50 So in terms of the roles and responsibilities of a product manager, they're responsible for guiding the development and success of a product or set of products. 00:59 They define what is our actual vision for this product, what is our strategy, and they make sure that everything aligns to the organization's overall objectives. 01:08 They're doing things like researching customer needs, they're prioritizing a set of features onto a roadmap, they're guiding the product through its entire life cycle. 01:16 So from coming up with an idea for a feature to actually launching it, maintaining it, growing it over time, and they're using data across all of this to make just, make, make really good decisions to improve the product. 01:28 So a couple key skills of a product manager. Number one, strategic thinking and planning. Number two, customer-centric mindset. This is really critical to have the user at the forefront of a product manager's mind to, make decisions that benefit them. 01:43 Number three, cross-functional collaboration. Four, communication and, uh, leadership. And then five, data analysis and actual decision making. So the main goal of a product manager is to really create successful products that are solving core, uh, user problems. 01:58 They're driving business value and, ultimately they align all the decisions they're making, all the features that they're working on, aligned to the organization's overall objectives. 02:09 So now on the other side, project managers, um, their roles and responsibilities. So they're responsible for planning, executing, and closing out projects, specific projects within an organization. 02:20 So the, , , , , , product manager may",Learn how to distinguish product manager and project manager responsibilities so you can clarify ownership of product strategy versus project delivery on your team.,a71fcdbb-701f-4efb-8d30-2deb84b2f48d,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Product manager vs. Project Manager,1.3,TRUE,13,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:20.69514+00
8ea69787c03141babd701461d3abab62,"00:01 Hello, welcome to lesson 1.4. In this lesson, I'm going to go over what are the actual different types of product managers out there that exist. 00:10 So in this lesson, I'm going to go over that the fact that there are different product managers that can exist within an organization. 00:18 I'll help you understand what these different, ,are and how they kind of differ from one another and what types of skills are actually relevant or required for different roles. 00:28 By the end of the lesson, you'll have a clear understanding of within a tech company, what are all the possible types of product managers that can exist? 00:35 What is the difference between them? How do their roles kind of differ? And hopefully you'll, have an understanding of how you can choose what type of product manager is best for you. 00:46 I'm going to move that over there. So the first one is just a generalist product manager. This is typically referred to as a product manager which may be obvious, but a generalist product manager is responsible for overseeing, the entire product life cycle from ideation to launch and beyond. 01:05 They really possess a broad set of skills like strategy, customer, resource, research, prioritization, and working across many different teams to collaborate. 01:16 Some common responsibilities of a regular product manager. And, and this may be, a little bit duplicative, but hopefully it'll help you to gain clarity between this role versus other types of product managers. 01:29 Number one, defining and communicating the vision and strategy. Two, researching the customer needs, translating those needs into product requirements. Three, prioritizing features and initiatives based on how, ,it can provide a value to the business and the customer. 01:44 And finally, collaborating with and managing multiple stakeholders. A quick example of what a generalist PM may do is a PM here may work on an online project management tool. 01:56 They're going to focus on understanding what does the customer need. They're going to prioritize features. They're going to collaborate with a bunch of different teams to actually make that happen. 02:06 Now, next we have a technical product manager. A technical PM, they're going to focus on much more technical aspects of a product. 02:14 They're often working much closer with really, you know, engineering heavy engineering teams. They possess, a very deep understanding of the technology stack. 02:24 The stack being, what are all the tools or technologies that we're using to actually have our product exist? What is the architecture of our product? 02:32 So what are the data models? How is everything built? And what are the engineering processes? And having this really deep understanding allows them to, to bridge the gap between them and other stakeholders. 02:46 The technical stakeholders being the engineers and the team. And the non-technical stakeholders like people in marketing who need to understand like what is happening on this team. 02:56 So some common responsibilities here. One is defining and documenting very technical requirements. So this is going to be very detailed documents that outline exactly how something should function. 03:08 And it's going to be very technical as opposed to more so like how should a user experience a product or a feature. 03:16 The next is collaborating with engineering teams very directly to ensure that the product development process is smooth. They want to identify and mitigate technical risks and challenges. 03:29 So this may be risks associated with APIs or infrastructure that they need to identify and help mitigate. And a big part of the technical PM role is actually communicating the really technical aspects. 03:45 So if you do have a background in technology and maybe you were an engineer and you also have the ability to translate something very technical into some simple terms that people can understand who are not on the engineering team, the technical PM role may be good for you. 04:02 The level of where a technical PM would really thrive and be necessary is a cloud storage service. This PM would work with the engineering teams to define what are the technical requirements here. 04:15 They're going to address scalability and security concerns. So scalability meaning can our product withstand, right now it can hold, A thousand users, but can it hold and withstand a million users? 04:26 Does it start to break down? Security concerns. You know, what are the open gaps when it comes to security? Is our users' data safe and are we storing things properly? 04:38 And also across all of the development and work that's happening, they want to make sure that, everything is running smoothly and being implemented properly. 04:46 The next is a growth product manager. So a growth PM is really focused in on driving user acquisition, engagement, and retention for a product. 04:55 So this is person who usually works at the top of the funnel. Top of the funnel is a phrase that refers to right when, users are finding out about the website, actually signing up in those first couple sessions, getting them hooked and engaged. 05:10 And growth PMs are really focused in on this specifically. So they are very data driven people. They're, they're using A-B testing and analytics to identify and strategize how can we maximize growth on the team. 05:24 You know, at the end of the day, a lot of what these PMs are doing is they're testing two versions of a feature to see what drives more acquisition, more engagement, et cetera. 05:43 These are. Specific ways where we can acquire more customers, more users onto the platform. We can engage them more. So they, if we have a set of 10 features and, and only 20% of users are actually engaging with them, they're going to work on how can we get that up to 50% or 80% of engagement? 06:00 And they're also focused on retaining users as well. As I mentioned. And they're going to run AB test experiments to validate different hypotheses that they come up with. 06:09 Like, okay, if we made our buttons blue would that drive additional clicks? Just as an example, they're going to analyze user behavior and conversion data to inform product decisions. 06:21 So they're going to take all the data that they're acquiring. By running these different experiments, and they're going to use it to help decide, okay, I think we should update this. 06:29 I think we should roll out to a hundred percent with this feature, et cetera. And they're really closely going to collaborate with marketing. 06:36 Again, as the top of the funnel, the marketing plays a huge part in getting users onto the platform in the first place. 06:42 And if the marketing is. Sending a specific message and the product is sending a different message, that's probably going to result in confused users and users dropping off. 06:52 So the growth PM and the marketing teams really work closely together to gain alignment and create experiences that make sense to users and actually convert them. 07:02 So an example of a, what a growth. Product manager may do they may be working for a social networking app and they would design and run experiments to optimize the onboarding experience for users. 07:12 So what are the first couple of screens on in the app that get the, the user into the app? They're going to work on optimizing engagement and retention and, and all the while they're doing this. 07:24 They're working with the marketing sales and customer success teams. Okay. So now a platform product manager a platform PM, they focus on developing and maintaining the underlying platform or infrastructure that supports multiple products or services. 07:40 And so what this means is you may have a bunch of user facing teams. Those are teams that are working on features that users are actually using. 07:48 And then you have a platform team that is actually developing kind of this foundational layer infrastructure to support those teams and what they're able to do. 07:56 They make sure that the platform is actually scalable. So to go back to the technical PM point that the, the platform can withstand a million years. 08:14 And that all the teams have the necessary capabilities to build upon. So if these means building certain infrastructure so that teams can. 08:25 And deploy new changes faster, the platform team may focus on building this. Some common responsibilities for a platform PM involve defining and communicating the platform teams, vision, and strategy. 08:38 They're going to work with collaborating with other engineering teams to develop and maintain this platform infrastructure. So kind of the user, the user in a sense of a platform team is actually the other engineering teams within a company. 08:52 They're gonna work on things like scalability, performance, and security issues. Performance being, as a very quick example, if you load a particular page, how long does it take for that page to load? 09:05 How fast? Are our systems? And they're also again gonna support other product teams that rely on the platform for their products. 09:14 So an example of a platform team is that a platform PM for a software as a service company, they would be responsible for developing and maintaining the core infrastructure, the APIs and services. 09:25 That enable all the other product teams within that SAS company to actually build and scale on top of. And we're gonna go into APIs in future lessons in module six. 09:36 But this is what a platform PM would be responsible for. The next one here is a mobile product manager. This is actually how I got started in product and I really enjoy. 09:46 I enjoy being a mobile PM, but they are PMs who specialize in developing and optimizing apps. Apps being on either iOS and Android. 09:55 So these are native applications as opposed to mobile web experiences. So for example, going on to Safari on your phone, that would be a mobile web experience. 10:04 And you'd have a regular, product manager deal with that experience. But when it comes down to an iOS app or an Android app, they're built very differently. 10:15 And so mobile product managers kind of specialize in that. They have a very deep understanding of what the mobile user experience is like. 10:22 And it's very different than the desktop. Or web experience because you can do a lot more things inside of an app that you can do in with just a website. 10:33 They also understand things like app store requirements and best practices when it comes to launching and maintaining apps. So again, similar to the other PMs, they're defining and communicating the mobile app vision industry. 10:46 They're going to collaborate with mobile designers and engineers to create this great, amazing mobile experience. They're going to ensure that the app actually integrates really well with the operating system. 10:59 So either iOS or Android and the app stores as well. And they're going to make sure that the platform specific challenge. 11:06 Challenges such as performance and battery life are attended to. So it would not be great if the app say, say you're working on the Google maps app and you have it as a GPS. 11:17 If it completely drains your battery in 10 minutes because it's doing so many functions in the background, that would obviously be a failure for Google maps. 11:26 So mobile PM is going to be really thinking about these specific problems and addressing them with their engineering team. So an example here is that a mobile PM for a ride sharing app like Lyft or Uber, they'd focus on optimizing, optimizing the UX, making sure there's seamless integration with the 11:43 mobile operating systems and app stores. What Lyft and Uber have recently been doing is they're now based on new iOS technology putting a live tracker of the car on your lock screen directly as opposed to just using notification. 11:59 So they're really making sure that they're making use of the operating system to gain there. Also, also thinking about performance and battery life as well. 12:10 Now, a data product manager is one that focuses on developing data driven products that may leverage things like machine learning, data analytics, or other more advanced technologies. 12:22 So, so the product that data product managers are focusing on is, is really the actual data that a company is collecting. 12:30 They have a deep understanding of data science and engineering, and that allows them to build and scale products that really get value out of large data sets. 12:40 You know, you could collect all the data in the world, but if you're not actually leveraging it and doing something with it, then it doesn't really make any sense. 12:47 It doesn't. Matter that you're collecting it. So similar to the other PMS, they're defining and communicating the data teams products, vision and strategy. 12:56 And these PMS are really closely collaborating with data scientists and engineering teams. And they're working on developing data driven product features. 13:06 A couple of things that that. A data PM may be specifically focused on our data quality. So is the data that we're getting actually accurate? 13:15 Is it easy to parse through? Are there weird quirks with it that we need to consider privacy? Are we accurately and in a safe way? 13:28 Collecting and storing this information. Privacy policies are really important. GDPR is a big consideration if your product is available in Europe. 13:37 And then finally security issues. How are we storing this data? Is it easy to access by someone who's trying to hack into our systems? 13:45 What, what holes do we need to patch up when it comes to, ,to our data? Because data is really, really, really important. 13:52 There have been huge scandals with big tech companies around how they're mismanaging data. So data product managers are going to be kind of at the forefront about making sure that the, the data is handled properly and safely within a company. 14:05 They're also going to analyze and interpret this data of course to, inform more product decisions. So an example here is that a data product manager at a healthcare company, they may work on a predictive model that identifies patients who are at risk for certain conditions. 14:21 So in doing this, they're going to collaborate with data scientists who are able to create these algorithms and these models to predict this. 14:29 And they're going to work with engineering teams to actually implement the model and develop it into the product. And they're also going to make sure that this model that they're creating ensures kind of meets privacy and regulatory requirements. 14:42 Okay. So how do you actually choose the right type of product manager role? I know I just listed a bunch of different types. 14:49 Most, I just want to point out most people are that first role, that, that generalist product manager role. But to dive in here, the first thing I think you should consider is what are your interests and passions? 15:01 So like what industries, technologies, or types of products are you actually most passionate about? Do you want to work on a part of the system where the end user are real people there, they're consuming the app, they're playing around with it, they're using it as a tool, or are you actually more interested 15:19 in, in being on a team that supports other teams and doing that? In a sense, it's almost easier because your users are your teammates. 15:29 They're the people. The company. And so a platform PM is, is kind of an interesting role where you can ensure that you have a direct line of communication to all your users, or are you really, really into mobile apps? 15:42 Do you love like the concept of an iPhone? You love playing on apps. Maybe you want to work on a mobile app specifically. 15:49 So. So aligning your role with your interests is going to really help you stay motivated and excited and happy to go to work. 15:57 Another thing to consider when choosing the right type of PM role is what are your strengths and skills? So do you have strengths and skills that align with a particular type of role? 16:08 For example, if you have an. Of. A background in engineering, being a technical PM may be a really great fit because you already have a lot of technology foundational knowledge versus. 16:20 If you have no tech experience at all, no engineering programming experience, going for a technical PM role probably doesn't make sense because if you were able to get into. 16:30 That role, you'd be completely learning from scratch and having a difficult time catching up. So think about what skills you already have. 16:37 A good, another example is like data. If you already are really good with data, it may be your data analysts or data scientists. 16:43 You want to pivot into product management. Being a data product manager makes a lot of sense as that transition. Period. 16:52 Lastly here the organization and team structure. So different orgs actually have different product management structures and that can impact what the product manager is actually working on. 17:02 So consider the particular company that you're applying to, what the team dynamics are, and what your opportunities for growth. Both would be if you went into a particular particular role. 17:15 Okay. So that is it for the lesson on how, what types of product manager roles are out there. I'll see you in the next lesson which is going to be focusing on transitioning into product management from different backgrounds. 17:28 I'll see you there.",Learn how to differentiate product manager role types and match them to your interests and skills so you can choose the best PM path.,5972ed0a-7e20-4ae0-ad5e-e3bc6f077b3a,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Types of PMs,1.4,TRUE,18,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:21.232388+00
489431139f0b4b2ba46a882d3831e540,"0:01 Hey, and welcome to lesson 1.5. This is going to be about transitioning into product from different backgrounds. So in this lesson, we're going to go over how you as a professional from any different type of background can successfully transition into a product manager role. 0:17 I'm going to cover some common backgrounds for which I see people transition, the skills and experiences that can be leveraged from those backgrounds, and some tips about how to actually make a smooth transition. 0:29 So by the end of this lesson, hopefully you'll have a better understanding of how your unique background and experiences can contribute to a successful career as a product manager. 0:38 I also want to mention that there's no background, one size if it's all background for a product manager, compared to someone who is doing engineering, for example, who probably had to study software engineering, either in school or through an intensive course and program to learn how to code. 0:58 You know, colleges don't offer a degree, a bachelor's degree in product management. A lot of it is learned doing, learned from courses like this one. 1:08 There are some master's programs popping up now, but traditionally, you know, people don't study product management and then go immediately do it out of college. 1:17 They're in a company and then they're transitioning in. So it's certainly possible and a lot of this, what this course is about is helping people transition from those related roles into a product manager role. 1:32 So I'm going to go into this in a little bit. So some common backgrounds for transitioning into product management. Number one, engineering. 1:41 So uh, different product managers can come from engineering backgrounds. Uh, they already have this skill set of how to build things, how the code works, et cetera. 1:50 Uh, so they can, um, really think outside of the box when it comes to thinking about their roadmap. Um, I, I see engineers who, uh, want to transition into product because they're, they're kind of tired of. 2:08 Uh, they already have this skill set of how to build things, how to build things, how to uh, designers sometimes transition into product management as well because they have a really deep understanding of the user experience and visual design aspects of developing products. 2:31 Um, so they can leverage their skill set in user centered design, prototyping, and user research, uh, which again is a really important part of the PM role. 2:40 So they already have that skill set built. Uh, they can transition into a PM role by leveraging those skills, uh, and, and also developing the other skills that are important in the role. 2:49 The third is around marketing. So, um, I, I actually helped someone from my previous company who was in the marketing department transition into a product manager role. 2:58 Um, they really bring a customer focused mindset and strong communication skills to the product manager roles. Um, they, they are good at doing market research, customer segmentation and messaging. 3:10 Uh, and, and all these components go into, uh, uh, delivering a really successful product. And so because marketing people already have that skillset built up, they can emphasize that, uh, as part of their existing skillsets. 3:22 And so that is a way to leverage and transition into product. Uh, the next one here is sales. So sales have a lot of firsthand experience interacting with customers. 3:32 And what did I go over in other lessons that, that PMs do research with customers. They're doing user interviews. They're trying to understand the customer needs and pay in points. 3:42 So salespeople already are getting this on a day-to-day basis. They're building that skill set. So they can leverage this, this customer facing experience when they're transitioning into their role. 3:52 Um, negotiation skills as well when it comes to even negotiating between internal stakeholders. Uh, stakeholder management again is a big one. 3:59 And sales people have this skill. So salespeople already have this skill set. Uh, built up. The last is customer support here. 4:05 So customer support, they're really well versed in addressing customer concerns and understanding the user experience. Um, they get to know exactly what the problems are. 4:15 They're dealing with all the customer complaints, all the customer questions and confusion. Um, so they built up a lot of empathy over time about, uh, the user base. 4:25 Uh, their ability to solve problems is, is probably excellent because they're constantly solving problems for users. And they also really have a lot of knowledge of the product. 4:34 Um, they, they know what is a common problem with users. They probably already know about ways to fix it. So customer support is is a very good transition into the product role because a lot of these skills are already developed. 4:48 I want to mention that these are a couple of the, the common roles that I see could transition into product, but nowhere near a fully comprehensive list of who can actually transition into a PM role. 4:58 So now we'll go over a couple tips, uh, transitioning in. So the number one, and I kind of went over this, uh, going through each of those jobs, but you want to leverage your existing skills and experience. 5:09 So take a look at what you've actually learned how to do. What are your skills up until this point? Uh, what experiences do you have and identify which ones are going to be most valuable in the product role. 5:21 And then once you do that, you want to. Emphasize that you actually already have those skills on your resume, your cover letter, and interviews to demonstrate, uh, that you can provide a lot of value as a product manager. 5:31 Um, so it's not like you're learning from scratch with all these skills. You already have developed certain skills and you want to leverage that. 5:38 You want to emphasize that when you're interviewing. The next is a network with PMs and other professional. So go to different events, conferences, meetups, connect with product managers and learn from their experience. 5:50 So maybe you see on LinkedIn that someone was in your role, your, your customer support role, and then eventually became a product manager. 5:57 Reach out to them. Say that you're interested in doing the same exact career move and see if they have any tips and advice for you. 6:03 Uh, they, they, they've gone through it. There have been successful with it. So don't be afraid to actually reach out to random people, ask about their experiences if they, if they line up, uh, with what your experience is. 6:14 Uh, and then also just seek out informational interviews with existing product managers to understand like, what is their day-to-day work like? 6:22 What challenges do they have? Uh, what, what, you know, what success have they had in their career? And this just helps you gain a stronger understanding of, you know, what it's like to be a product manager. 6:32 You can speak a more common language. Uh, the next is to gain hands-on experience. So you're likely already working in a company right now. 6:41 Um, you may be employed, but I th- Another way, look for opportunities to actually work on product-related projects. Um, so there's product and engineering teams at your company. 6:52 Reach out to them. See if you can help out in any way. Uh, product managers a lot of the time have a ton of things on their plate. 6:58 They have lots of t- of things on their to-do list. And so if you reach out and let them know, hey, let- like, do you need any help, um, you know, doing any competitor analysis? 7:08 Um, I'm happy to sit in and train on doing user interviews or, um, transcribing notes from user interviews. There's a lot of ways that you can contribute. 7:16 And when you get that experience, you can then put it on your resume. Um, you can talk about it in interviews. 7:22 Um, another thing you could do is, is take up freelance or consulting projects in product, um, to build out your portfolio. 7:29 Uh, I also teach how to do case studies and actually put it onto a portfolio, um, so that you can demonstrate that you have the skillset, uh, to actually solve a problem from beginning to end, uh, and present that in a nice aesthetically pleasing way. 7:42 The last tip I have, here is to be persistent and resilient. Uh, transitioning into a new career completely can be challenging. 7:50 Um, you know, it's definitely not without its challenges, but perseverance and resilience, having those, you can overcome a lot of obstacles and succeed in your desired product management role. 8:02 So try to stay motivated and committed. It's your goal continuously seek out different opportunities to learn, to improve yourself, to gain additional experience with a particular skill set, grow and develop over time. 8:17 Uh, by leveraging your background, your unique skills, your experiences, because you do have those already. Uh, by developing a strong understanding of product principles throughout this course, by networking with people in the field already, maybe people who have transitioned similar to what your transition 8:33 is going to look like. Gain hands-on experience doing case studies, doing side projects, working on projects at your own company. 8:41 You can make a smooth transition into product management. It's got to take a lot of work, but as long as you do all these things and actually stay motivated, actually do the work, it's going to work out and you're going to be able to land your dream PM role. 8:58 So I'm excited for you to continue moving on through these modules. And yeah, that's it for this lesson. Thanks.","Learn how to leverage your existing background, network, and gain hands-on experience so you can successfully transition into a product manager role.",12c5dcd3-55e1-42bd-b4cf-4287c90710fb,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Transitioning into Product,1.5,TRUE,10,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:21.705166+00
deb36139c04b416daa560f83c09b88ed,"00:00 Hello and welcome to Module 2, Understanding the Market and Customer Needs. In Lesson 2.1 here, we're going to go over Market Research and Analysis. 00:10 So we're going to discuss, first of all, the importance of doing this. And Market Research is otherwise known as and explained as User Research and Analysis This is important. 00:21 I'm going to go over some tools and methods to actually conduct this research and chat through why it is really important to do this to inform decisions that PMs are making on a day-to-day basis. 00:33 So by the end of this lesson, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and techniques to conduct this research and use it to inform your product. 00:40 So let's dive in. Why is market research and analysis so important in product management? Number one, and most importantly, it's a way to identify market opportunities. 00:53 So it helps us understand where are the gaps and opportunities in the market right now that can be addressed by products, features, and functions. 01:01 So if we notice that for our target user there is no product out there, there's a gap that in the way that it is solving a core pain point for our customer. 01:14 And if we build that, that means that it's going to be very likely that that customer, that core target um, target customer uses our product to solve the problem and pain point that they're having and hopefully they'll pay money for it. 01:28 So product managers are really looking out in competitors and in the market in general and trying to find little gaps here and there. 01:36 Little ways to optimize a solution, for example, and they're building that. They're prioritizing those features and they're building it so that when a target customer comes along and they see the whole suite of features that your product offers, they're checking off boxes in their head and they're, 01:54 they're comparing your product against others. And, and hopefully your product is checking more of those boxes. Because there are less gaps in your experience compared to a competitor's experience. 02:06 Number two is understanding the competitor, the customer needs, excuse me. So you want to make sure that you are always building solutions, features, functionality that addresses customer needs their, their needs, their preferences, their pain points. 02:22 You don't want to be just making features just for the sake of building. You want to make sure that the features you're actually prioritizing with your engineers are solving a pain point that your customer is having directly. 02:35 Number three is informing product strategy and positioning. So once you do all this market research, you, you have, a really strong understanding of where your product exists in the broader market and, and segment that you're operating in, you'll be able to really update and, and optimize your product 02:52 strategy and positioning to address different insights that you found. You want to make sure that your product's unique value proposition makes sense and you're positioning your product well against all the other products that are kind of tangentially related or solving the problem that your 03:09 customers are having. And then finally is reducing risk. As I'll go through in this course, engineers are a limited resource on your team. 03:20 You don't have a hundred engineers. At your disposal, you probably have like between four and eight engineers, which means that you need to be really critical with the stuff that you have your engineers actually work on. 03:31 And by conducting market research and analysis, looking at data, talking to customers, you can really reduce the risk of wasting your engineers time, building things that won't actually matter or won't actually solve any problems. 03:45 You're going to really understand these things at the forefront and make sure that your engineers are actually working on stuff that your customers want and need. 03:54 Okay. So I wanted to dive into an example of how market research has been used for a very popular product, the Apple iPhone. 04:04 So before launching the first iPhone in 2007, which feels like a century ago, Apple conducted a bunch of research to understand the needs and preferences of their target customers, which is ultimately everyone, really adults. 04:20 At the time, mobile phones were really you used for making phone calls and sending text messages. Ies for making phone calls and sending text messages. 05:21 Ies for making phone calls and sending text messages. ies for making phone calls and sending text messages. in that way. And they did this and packaged it in a really sleek, really easy to use, kind of revolutionary product. 05:30 And so their success can largely be attributed to making sure that they did thorough research and analysis to understand the opportunity and address what customers really wanted and needed. 05:42 And the introduction of the iPhone into the phone, cell phone, mobile phone market, really revolutionized everything and it set the standard for smartphones in the years to come. 05:54 So okay, we understand that doing market research, doing research in general, is really important, but how do we actually do it? 06:01 So there's primary research. And then there's secondary research. For primary research, that means actually gathering data directly from customers, users, or other stakeholders. 06:12 An example of this is sending out a survey to your customer base, doing interviews with your customers. So 30 minutes, 45, 60 minute Zoom sessions with your customers directly. 06:23 Doing focus groups, so getting a group of 10 people into a room and asking their group a question, observing them. 06:29 So this may mean like if you're in a B2B product, going to a business and observing how they're actually operating on a day to day basis so you can understand their pain points at a very deep, raw level. 06:42 And finally, doing user testing. So building a prototype of some sort, sending it out to potential customers or existing customers and seeing if they're finding value from it, if they're able to use it. 06:54 On the other hand, we have secondary research. So this involves analyzing existing data or info from external sources. So an example here is a market report or an analysis on an industry. 07:07 There's a lot of kind of these materials out there that look broadly at a whole entire market. Number two is looking at competitor websites. 07:16 So how are they messaging their product on their pricing page? What features are they listing in and in what order? 07:23 This is going to give you a good understanding of really what they view after months or years of testing as the most crucial features and pain points to be solved for their customers. 07:36 You can look on social media and online forums. Reddit I think is a great example of a place that you can go to hear people's raw thoughts on a particular product or, or pain points there they have associated to doing something like their job. 07:51 So what tools can you actually use when doing this analysis and research? So for surveys there are really popular platforms like SurveyMonkey or Google Forms. 08:00 Google Forms is great because it's free. SurveyMonkey is completely customizable. Typeform is another one. These can be used to get great quantitative data and they can be in a lot of ways customized to exactly what you want to get. 08:15 Number two is analytics and data visualization tools. So Google Analytics, Tableau as an example, because looking at raw data like the actual data points may be really difficult to identify trends or really find insights, but visualizing in some way, creating charts, creating tables. 08:36 This is going to be a much more effective way to identify these trends. Number three, customer feedback and user testing. 08:43 The one I like the most is called the user testing.com and that can be used to gather feedback from users and you're able to conduct usability testing, which means like you will send a prototype, you will send a feature and, and they will then be asked to perform certain tasks or actions on 09:02 the product. And then they'll answer. So questions on how easy it was to use or if they were confused and you'll be able to see live as people are trying to go through your product, what they're thinking in their head. 09:14 And then finally, competitive analysis tools like SEMrush, for example, this can help under product managers understand what are their competitors up to? 09:22 How much traffic do they have? What are their marketing efforts? You can really start to understand how are they viewing the world. 09:31 So in conclusion in this lesson, we kind of went over the importance of doing market research and analysis. Again, product managers want to make sure that we're not wasting our engineering resources and by really researching. 09:44 And understanding the broader market in which our product and company operates, we can make sure that we are reducing the risk of wasting our engineers times time. 09:55 We can identify these opportunities to fulfill customer needs, solve their problem, and ultimately all this goes into informing the product strategy. 10:04 And positioning.","Learn how to conduct primary and secondary market research using key tools so you can identify opportunities, validate customer needs, and guide product strategy decisions.",d9bbe43a-c485-447e-af90-6c8b1367539f,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Market research and analysis,2.1,TRUE,11,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:31.673829+00
9027bc1c98db411c90083225e9d86710,"00:00 In this lesson we're going to go over identifying customer needs. So we're going to first discuss the importance of doing it, we're going to dive into a couple different methods and tips on how you can gather information about your users and then go through an example at the end to really make sure you 00:17 understand the ways and what but you can, get out of identifying customer needs from your users. So let's see, so number one is we want to understand why it's important to actually identify the needs of your user base. 00:34 Number one is developing a customer-centric product. You want to make sure that the product features a and functionality that you're developing are really solving real problems and, and addressing the needs of your target audience. 00:49 It's, it's really critical that you don't build the features that you would want as a user. If you were that target customer, you really want to understand what the real person, the real target customer would actually want out of the product. 01:03 This is really important because a lot of the time, the product manager is, is not the customer of the product. 01:10 Maybe, maybe they are. For example, if you're a product manager for Google maps and you use Google maps as well, but a lot of the time a product manager is working on a product, where they may not be the actual customer. 01:24 And in order to actually build a successful product, you need to understand what the real customer wants and how the real customer would use the product and, and, and interact with the functionality. 01:36 Number two is prioritizing features and enhancements. Understanding customer needs will help you as a PM prioritize features and different improvements to your product that will have the greatest impact on customer satisfaction overall. 01:51 You may come up with a list of 10 different ideas that you have for a way to improve the experience. 01:57 And you may order them in a particular way based on what you think. But once you're done with that, you can do that. 02:05 When you actually send that out and gather insights from users, you may find out that what you thought was number seven in priority was actually number two. and what you thought was priority one is actually priority 10. Um, and so you, you want to make sure that you're actually using customer insights 05:28 when developing and prioritizing. features. Otherwise you may end up just getting a product out, um, that doesn't really satisfy the needs of your, your market. 02:29 Number three is reducing the risk of product failure. So when you are addressing customer needs directly you're going to be much less likely to have wasted engineering resources. 02:41 On features that, that aren't really effective or successful in any way. And then the last point here is that by really addressing customer needs directly, you're going to improve the retention and loyalty. 02:56 Customers and users generally, they, they want to see that the product that they are subscribing to. If you were using your iPhone and had the same software as what was originally I'll see you next time. 03:21 If you've already launched in 2007, you would almost definitely have gotten rid of your iPhone by now because it is completely, it would be completely behind its time and your product needs to be the same way. 03:32 You need to continually innovate in the area that your product operates in. And doing this is going to increase customer loyalty and retention. 03:42 Okay, so what are some tips for actually identifying customer needs and getting these insights? Number one is to be objective and unbiased. 03:52 You want to approach this research with an open mind. So it's really hard to do this, but you may have an idea in your head and you've thought about it a lot and you think oh, this is the right way to do this. 04:04 But when you're approaching research, you need to go into it without that mindset and instead with an open mind you don't want to make assumptions about what the customer needs based on what you think. 04:16 You want to, you go into that research kind of project without any preconceived notions about how things should work. Okay. 04:28 Number two here is to ask open-ended questions. If you want to encourage customers to share their thoughts and experiences by asking open-ended questions that promote kind of this in-depth conversation. 04:41 So this is similar to going on a date. For example, you, you want to avoid yes or no questions because it really doesn't help you understand a lot about the context of why they're answering it in a certain way. 04:53 So for example, did you grow up in New York? Yes or no. A better question would be what did you like about growing up in New York? 05:01 And that will launch into a full series of really interesting information that you can learn about, in, in this case, a user. 05:10 Number three is when you're asking these questions, either in person or over Zoom or through a survey, you want to listen actively and empathetically. 05:21 So you want to listen to their results. Again, the customer, the target customer is likely not you, and so you need to take a step out of your shoes and try to step into their shoes to see how they view the world. 05:38 What are their problems? How are they viewing these things? Okay continue on here. You want to look for patterns and trends. 05:45 So when you're talking to users, if multiple users are saying the same thing, you're gonna, you're gonna see, okay, this is a trend that is emerging. 05:54 This is clearly something that multiple users in our target audience are experiencing. And, and these needs then translate into product features and functionality that you can build. 06:07 Then finally, you want to involve cross-functional teams. So you want to involve design and engineering and sales and marketing in these research methods and projects because it helps to build empathy across the team. 06:22 So if an engine is sitting in a user interview and you will likely be driving the user interview or a researcher on your team would be, but if an engineer is sitting in and they hear a specific pain point or problem that the customer is experiencing, they may immediately think of a solution that you 06:40 didn't even think about because you're not an engineer. You don't have a technical background and having them in that room to directly hear from customers is going to help create a great product experience overall. 06:53 So involve cross-functional teams in the actual research, but definitely at minimum when you're reading it out and sharing it out with the rest of your team. 07:03 I wanted to share a real-world example of how you could identify customer needs and what they would actually do for your product, and the example is with a meal planning app. 07:12 So imagine you're a product manager and you're working on a new meal planning app that aims to help busy individuals plan and prepare healthy meals. 07:21 I'm sure this is a problem we all face. But to identify the customer needs you might use these methods. So first, user interviews. 07:29 You may do like 10, 60-minute, one-on-one interviews with potential users to understand their needs, their motivations, what is blocking them from achieving and solving this problem, what are their expectations or an app like this. 07:45 It could cover, and cover unmet needs and opportunities to differentiate what from what all the other competitors have already been doing in this space. 07:53 Number two is observational research. So you might spend some time observing these users as they plan and prepare meals. You can identify areas of frustration, and if efficiencies or unmet needs that your app could address. 08:08 Number three here, social media and online forums. There's probably a ton of information out there in different forums like Reddit related to meal planning or nutrition or cooking. 08:19 You want, you can, from reading through these forums and these threads, you can understand the concerns of your target audience. 08:26 You can see and try to identify these trends across them. And this is going to overall lead again to a way to improve the planning meal planning and prep process in general. 08:38 Next here is customer feedback and support tickets. So, review feedback and what actual, real customers are saying about other meal planning apps to identify common issues. 08:49 So, if you see a really popular meal planning app and you look in their reviews and you see a lot of two star reviews because people are finding it difficult to find the actual ingredients in the app, that is something that your app could address. 09:02 So, based on these insights, gather from a variety of these different research methods. You might discover that your target audience is struggling with the following. 09:11 One, finding healthy, easy to prepare recipes that cater to their dietary preferences and restrictions. So, maybe they're vegan or maybe they're pescatarian and finding these recipes. 09:24 It might be difficult for that audience. Number two is creating a shopping list based on the planned meals for the week. 09:29 So, people may find it easy to find the actual recipes, but then translating that into a shopping list might be difficult. 09:37 Keeping track of ingredients they already have at home to minimize food waste. I know this is a problem I experience. 09:43 So your app could you know, solve that problem in some way. Maybe it's based on the recipes and it automatically deducts the ingredients from your refrigerator or your kitchen. 09:56 Number four is scheduling meals around their busy lives and considering meal prep time. To prep meals, it actually does take time. 10:03 It's not like a 30-minute workout. So your product and your app could build and address features based on that actual insight. 10:13 So, in general, armed with this information, you can design an app now that effectively addresses all these customer needs. And if you had not done any of this research, if you didn't talk to any users, you would probably end up building an app that really is solving the pain points that you yourself 10:30 are experiencing when it comes to meal planning. And this might not address kind of the broader market as a whole. 10:36 So, in summary, it's really important to identify what do our real customers need, not us as product managers. What are our customers need? 10:46 And, and that, those insights, those trends are going to directly lead to features, functionality, and prioritization decisions for your product to ultimately build the best product that is, has the highest likelihood of being successful. 11:01 So hopefully that helps understand customer needs and how that translates a bit into the actual product strategy of your product.",Learn how to identify customer needs using unbiased research methods and patterns so you can prioritize product features that improve satisfaction and reduce failure risk.,4b9fc70e-0c3a-462e-a1a6-c4a4b0b354fa,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Identifying customer needs,2.2,TRUE,12,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:32.16188+00
229b78ea2f9a407f88165f71ff315690,"0:01 In Lesson 2.3 we're going to go over creating user personas. So what are user personas? User personas are a kind of thing that product managers and researchers and designers use to build empathy across their teams. 0:17 It helps PMs and engineers and whoever is working on the product development process to really think about the features that they're working in a particular way from the perspective and point of view of that target customer. 0:32 So by the end of this lesson you'll hopefully understand how to create user personas that they really accurately represent your target audience and then use that to guide the product development process. 0:43 So why is it important to do this in product management? Number one is developing empathy for users. As I mentioned it's really great to build empathy across your team so with engineers and designers by creating a clear and relatable picture of the target audience. 1:02 When you're building the product you might have a a data model that says okay we have user ID 3471 and user ID 3471 did this this and this and that's really kind of really difficult to actually translate that piece of data that that user in your data to an actual real live person with a background 1:24 and with pain points and so by developing these user personas it is a way to build empathy across your team. 1:32 Number two it guides product development decisions so they can act as a kind of constant reminder of who the product is being designed for ensuring that product decisions are made with the user's needs in mind. 1:45 Again going back to previous lessons you are not building the product for yourself. You're building the product for a specific target user and so a user persona is a way to really remind yourself of this and think okay would the user persona that we have developed based on research and all these other 2:03 methods would they think that we're solving this in the right way. It helps to make those decisions on the day to day workflows that you have. 2:14 Number three it helps foster team alignment. So it helps align cross-functional teams by providing a shared understanding of the product. Who are we actually building for? 2:23 Who are we marketing to? Etc. Lastly, prioritizing features and enhancements. So it can help product managers to prioritize the right features and enhancements based on the needs of their target market, their target audience. 2:37 So what are the key aspects of a user persona this thing? This user persona. Number one is demographics. So age, gender, education, occupation, location. 2:49 This can kind of give a great overview and context about the user's background. Number two is their goals and motivations. 2:57 So what are the primary goals that this target user has? What motivates them in relation to your product? And, and ultimately what drives them to use your product? 3:08 And then third, what are their pain points and challenges? What do they, what kind of problems do they face and pain points do they face when they're trying to achieve their goals? 3:17 This is what your product will aim to achieve. Behaviors and preferences. What are the behaviors and preferences that they have that relate to their, to your product? 3:27 How do they interact with technology? How do they make purchasing decisions? Including a quote or a personal motto is also great as well. 3:36 It, it really helps to paint the picture that this is a real person that is interacting with their product. And then finally, including a photo or an illustration is a great way to kind of give a face to the persona and it again makes it more relatable. 3:50 So, how do we create a user persona? Number one is conducting research which we've gone into in previous lessons, I won't go into much there, but doing user interviews, doing surveys, you're trying to build this idea of who is our real target audience. 4:05 Number two is to analyze the data that we have. So, look at data that you're tracking in your product. Look at the pain points that you've identified in surveys. 4:15 Look at their preferences. Number three is to segment your audience. So, you want to group your users all the time. All the users that use your product into different segments based on their shared characteristics, their shared needs, or their behaviors. 4:29 And then you want to actually create the detailed personas that you're going to present out to your team and use on a consistent basis. 4:38 And you're going to want to use elements from the methods above. You're going to want to validate and refine these personas over time. 4:45 So if you learn certain things after running experiments with your users, you may want to modify the personas that you've developed. 4:53 So just want to show a quick example of what a user persona for a fitness app could look like. So meet active Alice. 5:01 This is a user persona for a new fitness app and active Alice is 32 years old. She's female. She's college educated and she's a marketing manager and she lives in a suburban area. 5:14 Her goal in life in relation to our fitness app is to stay fit and healthy. She wants to maintain a regular workout routine and she wants to track her progress over time, but some pain points and challenges. 5:27 She has a limited time to do this due to a busy work schedule, being a marketing manager. She struggles to stay motivated over time and she finds it difficult to identify suitable workouts for her fitness level. 5:42 She does enjoy it. She does enjoy outdoor activities. She does use mobile apps to track her fitness progress and she prefers short but effective workouts compared to long multi hour workouts. 5:54 One quote that active Alice has said is I want to make the most of my limited workout time and stay motivated to reach my fitness goals. 6:01 So, developing a user persona like this could be really helpful for an engineer on your team who is in the weeds, in the code, to really contextualize what they're actually building for. 6:12 It's a real person who has goals and motivations and pain points as well. So, in summary, in this lesson, we went over how to create user personas, why they're important, and how can you, you can use it as a product manager in your day-to-day conversations with engineers and designers to really guide 6:32 product development decisions to really meet the user needs directly instead of the needs that you may think your users have without actually taking anything into account. 6:44 So hopefully that helps understand user personas.",Learn how to create research-based user personas so you can align teams and make product decisions that prioritize real user needs.,d2b134d8-a141-4dd5-8487-473ffd952dd9,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Creating user personas,2.3,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:32.796269+00
60df7450105d4f808d71d870632f2ae0,"00:00 In this lesson, we're going to go over conducting user interviews and surveys, so we'll discuss how to actually do it, how to get these insights from your target audience, and it's really important to note that these research methods play a really crucial role in understanding your user's needs validated 00:28 . So to dive in here the first one we're going to cover is user surveys. So some of the benefits of user surveys. 00:39 It's a very efficient way to get quantitative and qualitative data. If you ask questions with an other section that allow users to write in responses from a large number of users because it's automated, it is a form that you can just blast out to a bunch of people and have them submit responses 00:57 . So it's a great efficient way to get a lot of data. The ability, it also kind of gives you the ability to gather this standardized feedback and measure trends over time. 01:10 So if you're asking a question and there are four options you're going to get feedback in a very standardized format. 01:17 You're not going to have to try to dig into it more to infer what you want to do. What users are really meaning, you can see that 70% of users selected number two as their answer. 01:27 So this standardized format really helps to, to make the analysis part of this research method really easy. And then lastly, cost, it's cost effective and, and very scalable. 01:39 Typically you'll find that users don't really require money to do a survey, although it can help as an incentive. But if you send it out to a hundred users, you know, three to five of them will probably take your survey without requiring money at all. 01:56 And hopefully you have several thousand or tens of thousands of users that you could actually send. So when you're designing and conducting a user survey, the first thing you want to do is you want to determine the purpose of your survey. 02:10 Why, why is it a thing? Why are you actually surveying your users and identify the key insights you hope to gain? 02:18 Next, you're going to want to identify who's actually going to take this survey. Is it going to be sent to all of your users? 02:24 That likely is not the best plan. You don't really want to bother all of your users with a survey. There's such a thing as survey fatigue. 02:35 People get asked to do surveys a lot. So when you actually do deploy this method, you want to make sure you're not doing it to too many people that it's really valuable. 02:45 But who are the participants? What, what qualities or criteria should someone meet to be included in this survey? Do they have to have purchased something? 02:55 Do they do you want it so that they have not purchased something from your company? Then design the survey. You want to make clear, concise, and unbiased questions and use a mix of different, different question types. 03:10 So you, you could have multiple choice where you ask people to select from a list. You could do choose the most painful challenge you have using our product or choose as many challenges and pain points you have when using our product. 03:28 You could use a Likert scale. You could use open-ended questions where they type in the answers. Then you're going to want to distribute the survey. 03:36 So you want to use a distribution method that works for your user base that's most effective. So this may be by sending it by email. 03:46 This may be posting it on social media if you have really active social media for your product or putting in-app notifications to use. 03:55 So you may have a notification system where you can send users notifications and allow them to perform certain tasks. So you may be able to publish it in your app, in your product itself. 04:07 And then finally, when you're analyzing the results of your survey, you want to identify patterns and trends and insights from the data. 04:15 And this should really directly inform your product decisions. What you find in the survey results might validate it. Or invalidate assumptions that you had about the product or the users. 04:26 So you want to use these results to actually inform decisions that you're making. So the next is user interviews. There's a couple benefits of user interviews. 04:35 So number one is that you get a much more in-depth understanding of their needs, their motivations, and pain points. You can observe non-verbal cues and, and gather richer insights by way of talking to them instead of just someone completing a user survey 10, you know, 5 to 10 short questions. 04:54 And you also have the flexibility to explore new topics and ask follow-up questions during the conversation, which you can't really do in a user service. 05:02 So if you ask someone in a survey you know, what are your thoughts on this, they're going to give you a response and you really don't have the opportunity to dig in deeper there to understand at a deeper level what they're talking about. 05:15 In terms of planning and conducting, I put together this guide that you get access to as a part of the course. 05:22 And this will help for you to prepare and then actually execute the user interview. So I'll go over this pretty quickly. 05:30 So in terms of the prep that you'll want to do for a user interview it's, it's in a lot of ways similar to a survey, but you're going to want to define the objective of the interview. 05:40 What are you trying to get out of the interview? You're going to want to develop the guide. So outline the questions that you'll ask and the key topics that you want to explore when you're doing these 30, 45, or 60 minute sessions. 05:53 You want to identify what types of participants do you want. Are these new users who have not purchased? Have they performed certain actions? 06:02 Are they a certain day? Is it demographic or a certain location? Who are the participants? You'll want to prepare the environment. 06:09 So is this in person, in a meeting room? You're going to have people come to your office. Is it over the phone? 06:14 Is it over a video chat? This is really dependent on who your customers are and what you can make happen. 06:21 It's really great and I agree. It's a great idea to practice the interview process. So run through the questions. You could do this with a co-worker. 06:27 You could do this with yourself. But you want to get comfortable actually delivering the interview. And then finally, you might want to gather recording equipment. 06:36 So if it's for an in-person interview and you want to be able to see their phone on the table, you may have a camera. 06:44 You may want to get a camera where you can point it down at the device. So you can see how your users are actually interacting with the device in addition to filming them as well. 06:54 In the actual interview itself, there's a couple different kind of sections of the interview that you're going to. Want to do. 07:04 So the first is an introduction. You're going to want to say, hey Alex, thank you for participating today. We're conducting this interview to really understand, you know, whatever the purpose of the interview is. 07:16 And your insights are going to be really invaluable for us. But before we dive in, I just wanted to start with a few easy questions to get to know you. 07:25 So I'd love to understand if you could tell us a little bit about yourself. Then you can dive into the main questions. 07:32 So you want to ask these in open-ended ways. So can you share your experience regarding checking out on our app? 07:40 And then when they answer, you may say that's interesting. Can you explain more about that? And you want to probe. 07:46 You want to ask more questions to try to learn and, and, and get deeper insights from your users. They may say something on the surface, but if you ask more probing questions, they may start to reveal more about their, their true wants and needs. 08:03 Finally, you'll want to wrap it up at the end. Thank them for the insights that they gave you. You may say that you're going to send them a gift card for the time that they spent with you. 08:14 Wrap it up at the end. So a couple probing questions that you could ask. So if someone delivers, one of your users gives you an answer to something, you could say, can you provide more detail on that? 08:25 Or what made that experience significant for you? Or can you walk me through the process when you did XYZ? Can you give me a specific example of XYZ? 08:40 Let's see. Going down to tips for an effective interview. So the first thing you want to do is establish a report. 08:48 So you want to make the interviewee really comfortable. So you want to start with easy questions and genuinely express interest in their responses. 08:56 You also want to listen actively. So you You want to focus on their words. You want to maintain eye contact with them. 09:04 You want to use nonverbal cues to show that you're paying attention. So you can nod, you can raise your eyebrow, etc. 09:11 You also want to be neutral. So keep your own opinions and feelings out of the conversation to avoid influencing their responses. 09:18 You don't want them to people please in any way. So if you express you know, you, you like something. Thing. 09:24 A certain way they may want to people please in and say they, they believe the same thing. Also allow silence. 09:31 This, this is really awkward and difficult for some people, but give them time to think about their answers without rushing to fill the silence. 09:40 Ultimately, they will give you an answer. But they may need to think about it. For a second and that silence forces them to come up with an answer. 09:49 Additionally, you want to seek examples. So if they say something, you want to ask for specific examples or stories to understand their experiences better. 10:00 Finally, in terms of analyzing the interview, you want to. Ideally transcribe the interview. You want to convert the conversation into written form. 10:09 So it's easier to actually find insights from it and look back on it later on without have to listen to an audio recording or listen to a video recording. 10:18 You'll want to categorize responses. So you may want to develop a system to group similar responses together for the same questions. 10:29 Next, you want to identify themes. So are multiple users saying the same thing or experiencing the same challenge or pain point when you ask a specific question? 10:40 And then you want to visualize these findings. So you could use charts or graphs to illustrate. Important data points. So if you talk to 15 users and 11 out of 15 of them said a specific thing about your product or about the pain point that will be cool to visualize in a certain way. 10:58 And then finally, develop insights. So take everything that you're learning from these interviews, from these raw notes. And actually develop insights from them. 11:07 So you might want to say that it's, it appears from the user interviews that we've done that users really don't want to see coupons that are over 70% off because it demonstrates to them that the product is really cheap and it's not going to solve their problem. 11:26 Whatever, whatever the insights are, you want to develop these from all the user interviews that you're doing. Here's an example of a follow-up email template. 11:35 And then finally, I think this is really important is the report, the user research or interview report template. So there's a couple sections here. 11:44 And basically this is, a way to take everything that you did for your user interviews and put it into a report that you can then share out to executives, different stakeholders, your engineers, et cetera. 11:55 So the executive summary this, this might say this report summarizes findings from 15 user interviews conducted in September of 2020. 12:05 23. And we selected in terms of methodology, we selected participants based on their purchasing behavior and conducted 60 minute interviews via whatever. 12:16 Key findings from our user interviews include, and then bullet point that out. So include a finding include an insight, include quotes from the interviews itself. 12:27 I think that's really, really valuable because it, it helps anyone who wasn't in the actual sessions to really build empathy. 12:36 And then at the end, you can include recommendations. So based on these insights, we recommend building and testing XYZ feature. 12:43 And it makes sense that these it should make sense that the feature that you came up with in your recommendation ties back to the user research that you did and the insights that you gathered. 12:53 And then at the end, you can have an appendix with more detailed data. You can link out to the raw notes of the interviews, et cetera. 13:01 So hopefully this interviewing guide and preparation check. Checklists and templates and et cetera is going to help you to conduct these user interviews. 13:11 But if you have any questions at all, feel free to ask in Slack. I think user research is a really cool way to learn information from your users. 13:21 It does take more time, but again, it allows you to get those deeper insights. From your users. So I wanted to quickly go over an example scenario for what, what could come out of a user interview. 13:34 So this user interview and, you know, objective is we want to investigate workout motivation for our fitness app. So imagine you're a product manager for a fitness app, you want to investigate the factors that motivate users like active Alice, which we went over in the previous lesson 13:52 to exercise regularly. So we are going to do some user interviews. So we may come up with these questions on the left and we may get the answers on the right. 14:02 Can you tell me about your workout routine and how you stay motivated to. Active Alice may answer. I try to work out at least four times a week. 14:12 I stayed motivated by setting small achievable goals for myself and tracking my progress with a fitness app. Okay. What challenges or obstacles do you face when trying to maintain that consistent workout routine? 14:24 Well, time constraints in a busy workout. Schedule are my biggest challenges in maintaining this workout routine. Okay. Can you share an example of a time when you felt particularly the unmotivated or unmotivated to exercise and what factors influenced your motivation levels? 14:41 The user may respond. I felt very motivated when I completed a challenging workout. Okay. How do you use fitness apps or other tools to support your routine and motivation? 15:01 I use a fitness app to find new workouts, track my progress and receive reminders and encouragement to see. Stay on track. 15:07 So after conducting multiple interviews, you analyze the responses that you got from the 10 or 15 different users. You identify these patterns and trends and you might find that users like active Alice are motivated by setting achievable goals. 15:23 They want to track their progress over time. They don't mind. Just workouts they want to see from, you know, September to December. 15:31 What progress do they make? They also want to receive encouragement from the app. They're challenged by time constraints and busy work schedules. 15:39 That's, that's something that our target users are all experiencing. So based on these insights gathered from the user interviews, you can make informed product decisions to better support motivation. 15:51 So features that you could do. Enhancing goal setting and progress tracking features in the app. Maybe you don't have progress tracking right now and you want to build a first version of it or you want to, excuse me, enhance it further. 16:04 You could offer shorter time efficient workouts. So in, say you only have 45 to 60 minute workouts right now. You might want to offer 10 minute workouts, 15 minute workouts. 16:14 This is going to be much easier for active Alice to actually participate in. And then you also want to implement personalized reminders and motivational messages to encourage users to stay on track. 16:26 You could leverage AI. To do this. So if they complete a particular workout at a particular time, you could create a custom personalized message to encourage them and congratulate them on performing that workout in that given time. 16:41 So in conclusion, I know this is a longer lesson, but user research user interviews. Please. Surveys, they're really, really valuable to gather insights from your target audience. 16:52 They're essential for understanding their needs and getting to that deeper level of understanding that's allow you to create a product experience that far surpasses your competitors. 17:04 By effectively planning and executing these interviews. And surveys, you can gain insights necessary to develop a product that meets the needs of users like active Alice, but for your specific product. 17:16 So hopefully that helps understand how to conduct user interviews and user surveys.","Learn how to plan, run, and analyze user surveys and interviews so you can turn customer insights into evidence-based product decisions.",918c1278-4bd3-4965-87e8-b608e1ca090d,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Conducting user interviews and surveys,2.4,TRUE,18,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:33.252245+00
e7dbf60cf74c4d66a1969335cd3e6118,"00:01 Hello and welcome to module three. In this module we're going to go over product strategy and vision. Lesson 3.1 is on the product vision mission and objectives and how they kind of work together to help you create a nice strategy for your team that fits into your organization. 00:19 So in this lesson, We're going to go over some definitions here. We're going to talk about how these components serve as kind of the foundation for your entire product strategy and by the end of this lesson you'll understand how to craft a clear product vision and mission as well as communicate it to 00:36 the different stakeholders on your team. So the first thing I wanted to do here is, Fine, what is a product vision and what is a mission statement? 00:45 So a product vision is a long-term aspirational view of the impact your product will make on your target audience and the world. 00:52 It's really meant to be kind of this guiding star for your product development efforts. It should be very long-term looking. 01:00 So many, many years into the future and it really should paint a picture of how the world will actually look if your product area achieves what it's setting out to do. 01:10 The mission statement, on the other hand, is describing the purpose of your product and how it actually achieves the product vision. 01:17 It's a clear, concise statement outlining the product's core, ,function and value proposition. So the product vision is really important for four main reasons. 01:27 Number one, it provides a really clear and long-term direction for your product so that you know over the course of five years this is where we actually want to get to. 01:36 This is our North Star. Number two, it inspires and motivates your team and the state, ,holders around your company. This should act as this, again, this short but memorable statement that really makes your team members excited about the team they're on and the work that they're doing. 01:52 Number three, it ensures alignment across the organization. Make sure that people know this is what your team is supposed to be working on and, you know, that makes it very clear that when they have something that they want your team to do you know, they, there's alignment there that your team 02:09 is, has a specific vision and if that person's ask doesn't cleanly map to the vision of your team, it might not make sense for them to actually ask you and maybe ask someone else or find out a different way to solve. 02:21 The problem. And then for similar to what I was just describing, it acts as kind of a decision making filter for feature prioritization and resource allocation. 02:31 Again, if there is a decision that needs to be made about whether or not to work on something or whether a feature should be built in a certain way, you can always point to the product vision. 02:42 Is a way to make that decision to do something or not or to do it a certain way. In terms of crafting a compelling product vision, there's kind of four things that you should keep in mind. 02:53 Number one, first and foremost, and probably most important, is that you want to consider your target audience. You need to understand your users needs, pain points, and, Aspirations. 03:02 At the end of the day, your product area exists because you are solving some type of problem for your user. 03:09 So you need to understand what that is and paint a great picture of the future state of your problem, of your user, Excuse me, when you solve that problem. 03:18 Number two, you need to reflect on your company's mission and values. It needs to align, your product vision needs to align with the broader goals of the company. 03:28 It wouldn't really make sense if your team had a vision that was in conflict with the broader vision of a company. 03:34 The companies typically will have a vision statement that is extremely high level and aspirational and it is intense. It is intentionally broad and kind of vague sometimes so that each individual team can have a more specific vision that maps cleanly to that overall or overarching company mission and 03:56 vision statement. Number three is to focus on the impact. You want to describe the positive change that your product, will bring to the users that you have and to the world more broadly. 04:07 And then finally, it's always good to keep it concise and memorable. This is something that should be kind of a clear, compelling statement that people just can, you know, at the snap of a finger, remember, it rolls off the tongue, it shouldn't be very complicated and really long sentence. 04:22 It should be kind of concise and memorable for someone to better understand what your team's focus is. Now on the flip side, in terms of crafting a clear mission statement. 04:32 So again, there's four things to keep in mind here. One is describing the purpose of your product. So you want to explain the core function and the problem that your product is solving. 04:42 And that should map to your vision statement. Number two is to focus on the value proposition of your product. So you want to highlight the unique benefit and features that set your product apart from its competitors. 04:55 You know, why does your product exist? It should have some type of difference. Whether it's the user experience. Specific feature or set of features. 05:04 What is that that helps you set apart from different competitors? Number three is that your mission statement really needs to align with the product vision. 05:13 So the mission statement should be in support of the overall vision. And then finally, again, you want to keep this concise and easy to understand because it's going to be a lot easier for people to get on board with your mission statement if it's easy and short for them to understand. 05:29 Now, lastly, we have product objectives. And now product objectives are a bit more granular. They're typically created every quarter. And they're important for three reasons. 05:40 One, they actually take your product vision and mission. And they actually take your product vision and mission statement. And translate that into actionable, measurable goals that you can have on a quarterly basis. 05:49 The next is that they really guide feature prioritization and product roadmap planning. Teams don't just come up with things to build out of thin air. 05:57 All this needs to tie to a broader vision, a broader mission, and then objectives. And then number three, it provides a framework for tracking progress and evaluating success over time. 06:10 You know, teams don't just measure their success and whether or not they've shipped something or not. You know, teams don't just measure that over time. 06:24 So you can tell on a monthly basis or a weekly basis how the work the team is actually doing is mapping two different goals that they have, which ultimately, again, map up to that product vision. 06:36 Okay, so in terms of setting effective product objectives, there's four things to typically keep in mind. Number one is that they need to be very specific and measurable. 06:47 You want to define what success looks like and how it's going to actually be quantified. You need some way to measure it and pretty much anything can be measured. 06:57 So you need to find out how you can actually measure that and then set a goal around it. Number two is you want to make sure that they're actually achieved. 07:03 And realistic. So you want to be ambitious with the goals and objectives that you're setting on your team, but they should be attainable. 07:11 You know, if you have a team of 20 engineers, you're not going to say our objective is to launch a space shuttle into space. 07:19 Because that's clearly not achievable with a team that big, but you can. And actually say our goal is to develop this one component for the ship that is launching into space. 07:30 That's a lot more achievable, but still ambitious. Number three is that you should align the objectives that you're making with your product vision, mission, and overall company strategy. 07:40 So it should really support the direction that your product is going in. And these objectives should always map up to those statements that you've outlined before. 07:49 And then number four, you want to set a timeline for actually achieving these objectives. Is this going to be done in one week, one month, three months? 07:57 You want to make sure that it's very clearly communicated, the actual timeline that you think you would have. For achieving the objectives and getting to those quantifiable goalposts. 08:09 Okay, so to better explain vision, mission, and objectives, I'm going to go through a couple different examples here to hopefully help you better understand how these are crafted and work together in tandem to create a team strategy. 08:23 And so that the team, know what they're working on. So this first example is for an online language learning platform like Duolingo for example. 08:31 So the overall vision could be to empower people to connect and communicate across cultures by breaking down language barriers. And then the mission statement is to provide an engaging, effective, and, accessible language learning experience that brings people closer together. 08:48 So as you can see the product vision paints a really broad picture about, you know, we want to live in a world where people can connect and communicate across cultures. 08:59 Now the way to do this is by, you know, the way that we are doing this is providing an, engaging, effective, and accessible language learning experience that brings people closer together. 09:10 So hopefully you see kind of the difference between those two. It's very subtle and nuanced but the mission is how we are, you know, what our team or what our product is doing to achieve that overarching vision. 09:22 Now in terms of the product objectives, that we could develop for our team. Number one, we may want to increase user engagement by 25% within the next 12 months. 09:34 You know, this would bring us closer to our vision because users are more engaged, which means they're better learning the language and they're, and they're get, we're less cultures too. 09:46 We want to add support for three new languages by the end of Q2. Again, this maps up into our mission and vision statement. 09:52 We want to improve our user retention rate by 10% within the next month, six months. And then we finally want to achieve a net promoter score of eight or higher within the next nine months. 10:03 So all these objectives is you can see are different ways to actually measure our progress towards the mission and vision of our team. 10:12 Okay. To go into another example, the next one is a fitness tracking app. So the vision here is to inspire and empower individuals to lead healthier lives through personalized fitness tracking and motivation. 10:24 And then the mission is how we're exactly doing that to create a user friendly fitness tracking app that offers customized workout plans, progress tracking and motivational support. 10:35 Now the objectives, what are we going to be doing this quarter or this half of you or within the next year to actually achieve that vision. 10:43 Number one, we want to attract 50 thousand new users onto the platform within the next six months. You know, this is a big goal, but it could be achievable. 10:52 Number two, we want to increase the average user workout frequency by 15%. This means we want more of our users actually completing these workouts on a monthly basis, which is going to get us to our vision. 11:05 Number three, we want to launch two new workout program categories by the end of Q3. And finally, we want to achieve a customer satisfaction rating of 90% or higher within the next nine months. 11:17 So as you can see, again, all these objectives are quantifiable. There are things that we are empowered to do with our team to ultimately get to a place where. 11:25 Individuals are leading healthier lives. This vision, this higher level vision statement. Now, number three, this third example is about a sustainable e-commerce platform. 11:35 So the vision example could be to revolutionize the way people shop by offering a convenient eco-friendly platform that promotes sustainable and ethically sourced products and our mission. 11:46 So, the vision of this vision could be to connect consumers with sustainable brand and products while advocating for environmentally responsible shopping practices. 11:54 So again, this vision statement is very high level. We want to revolutionize the way people shop. And exactly how we're doing that is we're connecting consumers with sustainable brands and products. 12:06 So our product objectives, what are we doing on a quarterly, you know, every half year or yearly basis to actually get there? 12:15 Number one, we want to reach $2 million in revenue within the first year of operation. Number two, we want to onboard a hundred new environmentally conscious brands by the end of Q4. 12:26 If we don't have these brands, we won't be able to achieve our vision or mission statement. Number three, we want to actually reduce the platforms. 12:34 Carbon footprint by 20% within the next 18 months. We want to kind of do and make action based on the what we're saying we're doing as an overall company. 12:45 And then finally, we want to encourage you to take a look at the product. Increase the percentage of products with eco-friendly packaging to 85% within the next 12 months. 12:52 Maybe this is 60% right now. Maybe it's 40% right now, but we believe 85% is achievable and attainable and it will bring us closer to our overall vision for the company. 13:03 So in summary in this lesson I chatted about the importance of defining a really clear product vision mission statement and then setting measurable objectives to guide your product development efforts. 13:16 All of these work in tandem with one another. They're all really required and kind of foundational for your team to operate efficiently. 13:24 So remember that crafting your compelling vision, mission and objectives is really important and you want to not only do that, but communicate them well to your team and broader stakeholders across the company. 13:38 So that's it for this lesson. I will see you in the next one.","Learn how to craft and align product vision, mission, and measurable objectives so you can guide prioritization and communicate a clear strategy to stakeholders.",6df9f6c2-92c4-4c51-866a-56d13720de0b,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Defining product vision and objectives,3.1,TRUE,14,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:33.739857+00
2f1a7c8601b54fc0ae43ec60063e794c,"00:00 Welcome to lesson 3.2 Creating a Product Roadmap. So in this lesson, I'm going to discuss the process of actually creating a product roadmap, which is really a visual representation of what you're going to be working on moving forward. 00:14 A well-structured roadmap is going to help communicate to everyone across the company and within your own team. What is your vision and how are you actually going to achieve that vision? 00:25 So by the end of this lesson, you'll hopefully be able to create an effective roadmap for your team and adapt it as your product evolves over time. 00:33 So there's a couple different basics to a product roadmap. In terms of the purpose, number one, it's to communicate your product. 00:40 Vision and strategy and what you're actually doing to achieve that product vision and strategy. Number two, you want to prioritize and plan feature development and represent it on this roadmap. 00:53 So someone comes along and they'll understand, okay, this, you know, Anthony, the product manager is thinking about his team doing this. 01:01 So number three, you want to have a roadmap because it helps coordinate efforts across different teams and stakeholders. So one team may be working on feature a right now, but they rely on another team to support that feature. 01:18 And so those teams need to be working on. Those in tandem or that other team has to work on it before so that my team can accomplish feature a. 01:28 And so roadmaps help teams kind of work together to coordinate this cross-functionally. And then finally, it helps track progress and measure success. 01:37 So you can see over time, okay, these are all the things that we shipped. Here were all the initiatives that we had. 01:43 And this is the order in which we believed they should have been completed. Okay. So in terms of the components of a product roadmap there's kind of five key things here. 01:54 Number one is the timeframe. So you can have a short term roadmap or a long term roadmap or both. So in terms of short term, typically what I see is a quarter long roadmap. 02:05 That's three months out of the year. There's four quarters in a year and that's a decent amount of time to actually make progress in a lot of initiatives, but it's not too far, you know, you know, long that it would be impossible to actually accurately map out the specific finite details of what 02:24 you're going to ship in that timeframe. Now, long-term you could have a product roadmap that is a long-term view, but it's not as specific to like down to the granular details of what you're going to be doing. 02:37 It's more high level of, okay, in the next three to five years, we want to. I typically think that short-term is a lot better because roadmaps change all the time. 02:49 And so you don't, you don't want to be maintaining kind of this long-term roadmap and in tandem with a short-term one. 02:55 The next is themes. So high level focus areas or objectives. Your, your roadmap should. Be based on these areas or objectives as opposed to just random initiatives that make their way onto the roadmap. 03:08 Number three is the features. So this is, you know, probably one of the most important, this is the actual functionality or improvements that you want to make on your team. 03:17 Number four is initiative. So how does this tie into the broad strategy for the team you know, features map to these broader level initiatives and strategic efforts. 03:32 The roadmap is a way to represent that visually. And then finally milestones. So key dates, excuse me, or achievements. So you may have, a column for an estimated launch date expected launch date or the actual ship date. 03:48 So those are a couple different components of a product roadmap. Now in terms of crafting a product roadmap, it's a couple things that you should do. 03:57 So number one is from the previous lessons. You want to make sure your product vision and, objectives are actually defined. 04:04 So the roadmap should be a list of features and functionality that map up to the objectives that you've set out. 04:12 Number two is you want to gather different input from a bunch of different stakeholders. You're not going to be doing this by yourself. 04:18 You're in fact going to be doing it with a lot of different people different team members. From your engineering and design teams, the sales teams, the marketing teams, customer support. 04:29 You are really working on a quarterly basis or every six months to gather a bunch of ideas, feedback, and different requirements from around the company to ultimately get it onto your roadmap and then prioritize, which is number three. 04:43 So prioritize features and initiatives. You can use a prioritization framework and I'll go into these in the next lesson to really determine what are the most important and impactful things that your team could be working on at any given point in time. 04:56 You want to consider things like the customer value that the initiative is actually providing the business impact. Is this actually help us decrease churn, increase revenue, etc.? 05:06 What are the resource constraints? So you may have just three engineers. Can you accomplish something? And what are the dependencies I mentioned earlier that you may have to work with other teams to actually ship something. 05:18 So are you dependent on them to ship something first? You're going to want to consider all those different inputs when prioritizing. 05:27 And then number four is organizing your roadmap into this visual format. So you want to choose a way to represent things. 05:34 It can be timeline-based, goal-oriented, etc. You want to group things together so that it makes sense. You want to indicate where possible, different. 05:43 Timelines, dependencies, or milestones. And finally, you want to keep it simple and visually appealing so that when someone comes along they can easily understand, okay, these are the things that the team is working on. 05:54 Here are the dependencies. Here are how they map to the broader objectives, etc. Number five is you want to then share and communicate out your roadmap. 06:02 So you want to present, to definitely your team members. Hopefully they've been involved as you've created it, but also broader stakeholders. 06:10 People have interest in your product area. You want to use it as a tool in meetings, presentations, and updates. You know, commonly asked question of product managers is, you know, when are you working on this? 06:21 When are you working on that? Can we, Work on this? The roadmap is kind of the central location where you'll be able to communicate the actual timeline that you're going to be working under certain things. 06:33 And then number six is that on an ongoing basis, you want to update and actually adapt your roadmap. So as I mentioned before, the roadmaps of teams always change. 06:42 You always have new, information that comes up. You get new feedback, user interviews, you have differing business objectives from the executive team. 06:52 Things change all the time, so you need to be flexible and understand that the roadmap that you create at the beginning of the quarter will probably and most definitely change throughout the quarter and definitely throughout the year. 07:04 So be prepared to iterate on it with your team. So I just wanted to show a quick example of what a roadmap could look like, and I also have this as a resource as a template that you can duplicate. 07:15 So if you go to file, make a copy, and then you can use it for yourself. But kind of just to show a basic roadmap here, you have the feature name and column A. 07:24 This is, you know, what is the feature actually called? You want to typically call features internally kind of with a catchy name, like meal tracker, so people can easily understand it, even if that's not actually what it ends up being called to the end user. 07:38 You have a short description so that people can understand, okay, the meal tracker is a feature that allows people to track their meals and calories. 07:44 Every intake sounds good. Status, you're going to have not started in progress done as well as blocked. Lead, this is probably going to be the engineering lead on the project. 07:53 So for number two, Bill is the engineering lead for the meal tracker. PRD, that's in a link out to an actual product requirements document that you filled out. 08:04 Is out in granular detail all the different aspects of this project. Priority high. So, this is a way to better understand like what is actually most important for our team to do in what in which order. 08:17 This priority we would have come up with from what you'll learn in the next lesson. And then finally metric. This is the percent of users who track meals that represents an objective or a KPI typically that the feature is aligned to. 08:34 So, this is just an example. The template that I actually have and give access to is a little bit more updated and has more columns. 08:41 So, you'll have access to that from this. So, overall in this lesson, we really talked about the importance of creating a product roadmap. 08:51 It's kind of the foundation of what your team is working on and it needs to tie to your product vision, mission, as well as the objectives that you've set out to accomplish within a given quarter. 09:03 And. We want to make sure that when you're making your roadmap, you are talking to different people. You're not doing it by yourself. 09:11 You're getting input and you're getting alignment from different people across your team and across the company. Because if not, then there's going to be a lot of people that are unhappy with you when you decide to kind of go rogue and do your own thing. 09:24 So you always. Always want to make sure you're getting input from a bunch of different areas and different people, formulating that into your roadmap and making decisions. 09:33 And you are not going to make everyone happy with your roadmap. You're always going to have certain people who are disappointed that what they wanted to be on the roadmap didn't actually make it. 09:45 But that's your job as a product manager is to make those hard decisions because at the end of the day, you have an engineering team that costs the company a lot of money and you need to make sure that the features and initiatives that your team is working on have a strong return on investment. 10:01 Otherwise, there is no real purpose or need for the company. So hopefully that helps to understand the importance of creating a great product roadmap for your team. 10:12 In the next lesson, we'll go into prioritization.",Learn how to create and iterate a product roadmap aligned to vision and objectives so you can prioritize work and communicate plans across stakeholders.,38d2dbbd-f309-4abe-bacd-c29e1fee7744,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Creating a product roadmap,3.2,TRUE,11,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:34.297552+00
e34e8dc75b6646b09645b3abf47e0f2d,"00:00 Welcome to Lesson 3.3. In this lesson, we're going to go over prioritizing features and initiatives. So, oftentimes as a PM, you're going to need to make decisions on which features should you be working on next. 00:14 You need to, you'll typically need to like weigh two different features against one another, or a set of features for your roadmap. 00:21 You're constantly making these prioritization decisions. And so, there are a couple different frameworks that can help PMs through this process in a bit of a more structured way. 00:31 And in this lesson, we're going to dive into a couple of those. So the first one is in Moscow. So this is an acronym that stands for must have, should have, could have. 00:42 And this helps you kind of categorize these different features or initiatives based on their importance and urgency. So, to dive deep into the actual categories here, must have. 00:53 These are features that are absolutely critical for your product success, or they're required to meet legal or regulatory requirements. For example, login. 01:02 You need to be able to log into your app for it to be functioning. So, if you don't have that, that is a must have. 01:09 Number two is should have. These are features that are definitely important, but they're not as critical and must have as the must apps. 01:16 So, they have workarounds, but the product would definitely suffer. If we don't have them. The third is could have. So, these are the nice to haves. 01:25 These are things that will enhance the experience, but they're absolutely not essential. And they can be postponed without a huge impact on your product success. 01:35 And then finally, we have won't haves. These are features that are just not a priority right now for a variety of different reasons. 01:42 They're just something that we don't want or don't have the capacity to do right now. So, just to show you a little example here, we can imagine that we're a product manager for a fitness tracking app. 01:54 In terms of must haves, there are two main ones here. Basic workout tracking, which makes sense. We need workout tracking. 02:01 If we want to have a fitness tracking app. And then number two is user registration and authentication. People need to be able to sign up and actually log in to the app so that they can do their basic workout tracking. 02:15 So these are absolutely must haves. We need to do these first. If we don't have them, we don't even have an app. 02:20 Next is should haves. So a goal setting and workout history. Ideally in a fitness tracking app, we are reaching goals. 02:29 We're actually seeing how we're trending towards goals and we can see the workout history that we've had. That would make sense. 02:36 These are you know, again, really important aspects of our app experience, but they're not as important. As these two must haves up here. 02:44 And then number three is the could haves. These are definitely nice to haves. Social sharing and workout badges and rewards are definitely going to enhance the experience in a positive way, but they're definitely not, you know, really urgent, really important compared to goal setting or basic workout 03:00 tracking. And then finally, we're going to talk about the third party fitness devices. This is an example of, you know, maybe someone from around the company said, let's integrate with third party fitness devices. 03:10 This is an example of something that could be considered for the future, but we're just not going to be doing, be doing it right now. 03:17 We may not have the resources to do it. We may have these other must haves that are a lot more important to get. 03:22 Out of the way, maybe once we've knocked out all these different features and see how our metrics are doing, we can consider expanding and integrating with third party fitness devices. 03:31 Okay. So to move along the next framework here is the rice framework framework, and this is actually my preferred model. 03:38 So rice stands for reach, impact, confidence, and effort. The framework is really a way to help you score and prioritize features or initiatives based on potential benefits and the required resources. 03:51 By resources, we're mainly talking about engineering resources. And so to dive into each one of those, reach number one, we want to estimate the number of users that will actually be affected by the, feature within a specific time frame. 04:05 So how far is this is this feature reaching out? The next is impact. So we want to understand the effect on user satisfaction, engagement, or other key metrics. 04:17 You know, is this going to be highly impactful? Or is this kind of incremental improvement? So it will improve the situation, but not in a major way. 04:29 Number three is confidence. So what is our actual confidence around our reach and impact? Do we have a good understanding based on data that we have that will, it will reach a certain number of users or it will have some guaranteed effect on user satisfaction? 04:46 Let's assess kind of our, our level of confidence here. And then finally, effort. This is where we want to estimate in conjunction with our tech lead or the engineers on our team, the actual amount of resources or time it will take to accomplish this feature. 05:01 You know, is this a one week? Task? Is this a one year task? Those are gonna be two very different time frames that impact the other aspects here. 05:10 So I'll go through a quick example here. And this is for a sustainable e-commerce platform. So the feature could be user friendly search filters. 05:19 So these are very common on, on different search platforms. Users come to expect it. And the reach here is gonna be very high because you know, the main thing to do on an e-commerce platform is actually to search. 05:34 So we can expect 10,000 users to actually be able to interact with these search filters. We think the impact is going to be around. 05:43 The moderate, a moderate level of impact, you know, it's not gonna be minimal. Like people are actually are definitely gonna use these search filters. 05:50 It'll help them find what they need faster, but it won't be significant. It's not gonna completely change the way that they actually find different items on the e-commerce platform. 06:01 In terms of confidence, we're, you know, 80% confident that it's gonna reach this many users, and it'll have a moderate impact based on some user research that we did in the past. 06:12 And I talked to the engineers and it's gonna take 10 days to implement this. So what we're gonna do is then multiply 10,000 times three. 06:21 So the reach times impact to three times 80% confidence. We'll divide that by the effort involved. So 10 days, we get a score of 2,400. 06:31 Okay. Moving on to the next feature on our roadmap that we're considering is carbon offset options at checkout. So only 900 users right now per month actually reach to checkout. 06:42 And of those users, they're pretty high in 10. And we believe based on the research that we've done that if we have a carbon offset option at checkout, they're gonna be much more likely to actually check out. 06:56 So we're saying we have high impact here. And we're very confident on this because we've done research in the past. 07:04 In this area and the effort involved here is so minimal. It's, it's just two days. So in two days, we can have this carbon offset option at checkout. 07:13 It seems like a clear win, right? Well, at 900 users per month and high confidence, not significant and 90% confident with two days, we get a score of 6. 07:24 1620 which means that, you know, this is still pretty high. There's probably going to be features lower than that, but it's still not as impactful as user friendly search filters. 07:34 That has a score of 2400. You know, if we implement this feature here, 10,000 users per month are going to experience it. 07:43 We may actually increase this from 900 to a thousand or 1100, which is going to have a much bigger impact on our bottom line. 07:51 And then next we can do this carbon offset option at checkout. Okay. So to move on to the next one, this third one is called value versus effort. 08:00 And this helps you prioritize features or initiatives by compare. And this is going to help you prioritize your effort by comparing their perceived value against their effort required to implement them. 08:08 So it's very similar to rice, although it doesn't take into account every single vector there. So it's oftentimes visualized in this two by two matrix that I've laid out for you. 08:18 Value is on the vertical access and effort is on the horizontal axis. So we have high value up here. And then low effort here and high effort here. 08:29 So what your team is going to want to work on first is the high value, low effort items. These are really going to be the best return on investment for your team. 08:38 Next, you're going to want to work on high value, high effort items because while they will. Require significant resources, they still have a really high value and impact. 08:49 The next one, if you have time, is the low value, low effort stuff. These are kind of the quick, small wins, but they really won't impact your product in a major way. 09:01 And then finally, you want to avoid features that are low value and high effort. You don't want something that's in it very incrementally change your metrics, but it may take weeks or months to build. 09:11 That sounds like a waste of time to me. So to show you an example for the fitness tracking app, We may have a high value, low effort feature here of enhanced goal setting and personalized workout recommendations. 09:24 We believe that we may be able to personalize the workouts that we're actually recommending to a client based on goals that they set in an easy to do way. 09:34 And we believe based on the user research that we've done and competitor analysis that that's going to have a high value. 09:40 Also high effort, but high value is an app. We believe that the current version is just not up to par with other apps that that will really enhance the user experience as well as new workout categories. 09:54 This is going to take time to actually build, but we believe that it'll have high value to go straight to this last quarter here. 10:03 It's going to be high effort, low value. Integrating with third party fitness devices, you know, based on our research, based on our conversations with engineers, we don't believe that this is really going to bring the, bring the user base or our bottom line forward too far. 10:18 But it will be a significant project. It'll take a lot of time. So we're going to want to avoid features like this for now. 10:25 Okay. So in terms of choosing the right framework, there's two things here. In terms of factors to consider you want to think about your team size and structure. 10:35 Do you have the right engineers on your team to actually accomplish something? Do you have a mobile engineer? Do you have web engineers, et cetera? 10:41 You want to understand the product stage you're in and the comp complexity of the features that you're working on. And I'll go into that in later modules. 10:49 Number three is industry and market conditions. So what's happening right now in the market? You know, should we consider something else in addition as a way to prioritize for, for example, safety. 11:02 Maybe you work at a ride hailing app like Uber or Lyft. And safety is a huge concern right now in the market. 11:08 Maybe you're going to want to weigh another category for safety. And you could add that into the rice framework, for example. 11:16 And then finally, the available resources and time constraints. I wanted to mention that you also can combine different elements from these different frameworks to make a cut. 11:25 You can create an customized approach that works for your team. You definitely don't, excuse me, don't need to use one of these frameworks exactly how they're laid out. 11:35 You can create an approach that works best for your team. I wanted to quickly touch on prioritization in the real world. 11:43 So, prioritization is one of the most, important things that a product manager can actually do. And in the real world, you're always gonna have to make major trade-offs and say no to stakeholders so that your team can achieve their vision. 11:57 This is not easy to do, especially if you're a people pleaser like myself. But at the end of the day, you have a team of limited resources, limited engineers. 12:06 You don't have all the engineers in the world. So you need to make sure that your team is always working on the most important impactful features at any given time. 12:15 That is your responsibility as the product manager. So it's important that you spend time on this. You don't have to work on the best performance. 12:27 And then also frameworks are just tools to help you think in a more principled or structured way. But you don't need to stick to them in all cases. 12:36 But they can kind of help you think methodically about what your team should work on next. A good example here is that if something doesn't have a high score, but you feel in your gut that it would be a major win for users in the company, you should feel empowered to prioritize it above another 12:53 initiative. At the end of the day, like these free frameworks are just a tool to help you get to a great roadmap, but you're also, you know, a smart person who knows what they're talking about. 13:05 You know, you know, with your product, the metrics, the data, the users, the pinpoints if it doesn't exactly map out exactly how you think it should feel free to move things around. 13:16 It's not set in stone. In terms of stakeholder input and buy-in. So it's really important that you get stakeholder perspectives during this process. 13:26 And a couple of those people that are important are different executives. You know, these are your directors or products, VPs or products, chief product officer, et cetera. 13:37 Engineers on your team, especially your tech lead, the designer on your team or other designers across the company, your sales team, et cetera. 13:44 You want to get buy-in from the. These different people and use them as inputs for your prioritization. And then external stakeholders as well. 13:52 These could be customers or partners. You know, these are people who also have input into the features that you may be working on. 14:00 Customers will typically, you know, if there's pretty good product market fit, they're going to be wanting, they're going to want to be asking for more. 14:07 Or even more features that make their experience better. In terms of tips for gathering and managing all this feedback that may be coming in for your prioritization. 14:15 Number one, you want to regularly meet with these key stakeholders. So you want to have, you know, have a recurring meeting with them, understand, you know, their POV, their point of view at any given point. 14:27 And time and see how that trends over time. Number two, you could facilitate workshops or brainstorming sessions. So you may get in, you know, all these people into one room. 14:36 You could get an executive, the tech lead, the designer, the head of sales, head of customer support into a room and say, you know what? 14:44 We're going to really think deeply about our product. Area today. And then number three is that you want to, you know, obviously continually collect customer feedback through surveys, interview, user testing, etc. 14:55 And use that as input into your prioritization process. The next slide here is around balancing short term versus long term priorities. 15:05 So you want to weigh the benefits of quick wins against long term strategic initiatives that may may may take three, six months to a year, even. 15:16 Because if you're only ever working on small quick improvements, you may miss out on some longer term big wins that your team could have that your competitors may be working on. 15:27 So assess the immediate impact on customer satisfaction and business metrics, but also consider the long term value and potential for growth of a particular area or initiative and then balancing priorities in practice. 15:41 So you want to allocate resources to both short term and long term initiatives again so that you can stay competitive. 15:49 And regularly assess this over time and adjust that balance as needed. You know, maybe right now you need a bunch of quick wins. 15:56 So you're doing 80% of the time is on quick short term items, whereas 20% is on these longer term initiatives. 16:04 But then you knock a lot of those quick wins out of the way. So you can. Go to a 50 50 approach. 16:10 So constantly think about this and evaluate whether or not you need to change something. The next here is aligning these priorities with company goals and objectives. 16:18 So. You want to revisit your mission and vision statement over time to ensure that the prioritized features and initiatives align with the organization's. 16:28 Purpose and values. So over time, you're going to want to say, okay, is what we're working on actually mapping to our mission and vision statement? 16:37 Does this make sense? Does this align? And if it doesn't, you may want to revisit your mission and vision statement. 16:43 Or you may on the flip side, want to revisit the feature that you're working on. Take that into. Who, you know take that into consideration when you're, when you're considering prioritization prioritizing, prioritizing, excuse me specific features. 16:58 Number two here is understanding the broader business strategy. So you want to consider how is the company actually positioned right now? 17:06 What does the target market look like and what are growth objectives? Is the work that we're doing going to be mapping up two different objectives that we have as a company to grow our bottom line? 17:16 In terms of prioritization, you want to take an iterative approach and have an iterative mindset. So you want to recognize that prioritization is an ongoing process and you need to adjust priorities as the conditions. 17:29 So you may make a decision today about whether or not you want to prioritize a feature, but then in three days, you may have new information and you may roll back your decision on what you decided today. 17:42 So have that mindset of it is okay to iterate on this. Nothing is ever set in stone 100%. You can make changes. 17:51 You want to monitor product performance, market trends, and stakeholder feedback to make this iterative change and improvement over time. And you also want to make sure that you're using data in these decisions to refine your priorities. 18:07 You don't want to make changes to your priorities. You want to make changes to your priorities. So, in summary, this lesson, it was a bit on the long side, but hopefully it helped you understand a couple of these different prioritization frameworks. 18:24 Again, RICE is my preferred framework. It's pretty easy for people to understand and compare. Different things against each other, whereas Moscow or value versus effort, those could become a little more contentious because it's more subjective around what is a must have versus a should have. 18:41 But hopefully they offer a unique perspective to priorities prioritizing features on your roadmap. You want to make sure that you're using data. 18:50 To actually supplement this prioritization process. But ultimately this is an iterative process. It changes over time. The inputs change, but hopefully it helps you to make decisions for your team about what should be worked on next. 19:05 Alright, that's it for this lesson. I'll see you in the next one.","Learn how to prioritize product features using MoSCoW, RICE, and value-versus-effort frameworks so you can choose the highest-impact roadmap items with limited resources.",8ded2c7d-1afb-4ec7-9f6d-a498be067a41,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Prioritizing features and initiatives,3.3,TRUE,20,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:34.853391+00
c18d7fb028174fd69ba7f7766ba13c85,"0:00 Welcome to lesson 3.4, around KPIs, keep performance indicators. So quick introduction to KPIs. To define them, they are quantifiable measures that help organizations evaluate progress towards strategic objectives. 0:17 They are, uh, performance indicators that reflect the success of a product or feature. So what does that actually mean? Uh, these are metrics, these are numbers, data that really helps to align your team on a strategic initiative. 0:32 So if you're working on implementing some specific feature, KPIs are a way to help you measure if you're successful or not doing that. 0:42 In terms of the importance of KPIs in product management, one, you want to impact the impact of different decisions that you're making. 0:51 So if you make a bunch of decisions over the course of months, How does it actually impact your KPIs, your metrics over time? 0:59 Number two, you want to help guide ongoing development and optimization of your product by considering KPIs. So are your KPIs improving over time? 1:11 Or are they going down? Number three, you want to align team efforts around common goals. And finally, you want to communicate progress to stakeholders. 1:20 So your KPIs for your team. These are to be metrics that your boss and your boss's boss are intimately familiar with and they're trying to see how this is changing over time. 1:32 It's ultimately a way to measure if your team is being successful or not. So in terms of understanding what are the relevant KPIs for your product, number one, what you want to understand is your product's objectives and goals. 1:44 So review the vision and strategy that you came up with or that has been already set for your team. and you want to identify the desired outcomes and impacts of your users based on those objectives and vision. 1:59 And then in terms of selecting the actual KPIs, you want to choose metrics that relate directly to your objectives and goals. 2:07 Those should reflect customer engagement, satisfaction, retention, et cetera, revenue, and a bunch of different ways to look at how your product is impacting the overall business and make sure that the KPIs that you're tracking are actually actionable and can inform decision-making. 2:27 For example, like if you're working on a growth team and you have a KPI around visitors, visitors to your landing page, if your team is not the one actually driving traffic to that page, you may not want to track this as a KPI. 2:46 That could be a KPI for a marketing team whose goal is to drive traffic towards that specific page. So make sure that they're actually actionable for your specific product area and can inform product decisions off of it. 2:59 So the other thing you want to do is set smart KPI's. Smart stands for specific measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound. 3:07 So specific. They should be clearly defined and focused on a particular aspect of performance. You know, revenue is all-encompassing. This is a very high-level KPI, a lot goes into revenue, but you could have KPI's that are a little bit more specific to your product area that tie into revenue, ultimately 3:29 . Number two is they need to be measurable. You need to be able to quantify this KPI and track it over time. 3:37 Number three is achievable. So the goal that you come up with needs to become, needs to be realistic and attainable with the team that you have and the constraints that you have in terms of time, etc. 3:50 Number four is relevant. The KPIs, again that you're tracking, need to be aligned with the goals and objective of your team and then time bound. 3:59 Do you want to make sure that the KPIs you're looking at are targeted around a specific amount of time where you're focused on achieving that KPI. 4:10 In terms of defining KPI targets, the targets that you want to set should be ambitious but achievable. So maybe your conversion rate right now is 10% and you believe that you could get up to 11% by the end of the quarter. 4:25 That may seem small, but it's actually a pretty major change. You want to use historical data, benchmarking, and research to inform the targets that you actually set. 4:36 So in terms of tracking and monitoring your KPIs, there's a couple of things that you want to keep in mind. 4:42 Number one is you want to establish a system. So you may have a product analytics tool that your team is using or a data visualization software like Looker. 4:53 You want to make a dashboard or some type of system to actually monitor your KPIs over time and in real time. 5:00 Hopefully it should be calculated on a consistent basis without you having to do a manual analysis every time. Number two is that you want to review how your KPIs are doing over time. 5:10 So this may be on a weekly basis every two weeks. You want to actually compare what it is right now in the given time against what you're targeting. 5:20 So if we start out at 10% and our goal is 11%, have we gotten it up to 10.1%, 10.2%, et cetera? 5:27 So look at this over time, identify trends, patterns, and see where you can improve. And then finally, you can adjust KPIs and target. 5:35 So revise them as needed if you get new insights or the market changes or your product strategy changes, which is all possible, you may want to just update your KPIs and targets as needed. 5:47 You know, I wouldn't be afraid to do this, you know, obviously back it up and justify it, but if you start the quarter at 10%, and you're trying to get to 11%, but another team may have done something that majorly impacted the conversion rate. 6:03 You may want to just adjust your target down because now it may be unachievable, given the change that the other team has made. 6:09 So be flexible here, adapt, but make sure that the KPIs that you have are, you know, achievable, but ambitious as well. 6:20 In terms of a couple examples here, just to help you understand if we are running an e-commerce mobile app and our objective is to increase our customer retention and repeat purchases. 6:33 What we may be looking at in terms of key performance indicators for that objective could be monthly active users. If we're increasing retention, monthly active users should be going up. 6:44 Repeat purchases is, you know, we could see our average order value or our repeat purchase rate. So the amount of times a user purchases one thing and then purchases again. 6:55 for project management software, maybe their objective is to improve user productivity and efficiency. Okay, we want to improve productivity and efficiency, but how can we actually track that that is actually happening? 7:09 And we're actually successful in improving efficiency and productivity. So number one might be task completion rate. So maybe this is checking off things on it to do list. 7:20 So how many users start doing that and actually complete it? what is the time that it takes to complete tasks? 7:27 So if you start a task on one hour and then complete an hour later, if over time the average of that goes down, maybe you're signaling that you're creating more efficient process. 7:40 What is the satisfaction score? So this may be a way to track this over time. So these are just examples of different key performance indicators that you could have that map up to objectives. 7:51 So, overall, hopefully by following these steps, you can set up and track KPIs over time. And these KPIs again, they should have really mapped to the objectives that you have for a given quarter, which ultimately map up to your vision. 8:08 So you can think about KPIs as ways to measure whether or not you are successfully on track or not towards achieving the vision that you set out for your team. 8:19 Alright, hopefully that helps and I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to choose, set, and track actionable SMART KPIs tied to product objectives so you can measure success and communicate progress to stakeholders.",35823133-c588-48e8-a0ef-37cc8c8a9f41,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Setting and tracking KPIs,3.4,TRUE,9,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:35.329367+00
46a12960f447425db994384cf96fd09a,"0:00 Welcome to lesson 3.5. This is going to be about understanding and analyzing the competitive landscape that your product lives in. 0:09 So just to define what is a competitive landscape, it's really the market context in which your product is competing. It's the set of direct and indirect competitors in your industry. 0:20 Or niche. Kind of centered around the problem that you're solving. In terms of the importance of understanding competitive landscapes, there's three kind of components here. 0:30 One, identifying opportunities that you have and also threats against your company. Two, assess the product positioning. And finally, it helps you guide your strategy. 0:40 And decision making process. So in terms of methods for analyzing competitive landscapes, there's a couple different components here. And number one, conducting market research. 0:52 So you can understand and analyze the market size that you're in, different trends and growth potential. So are you in the right? 1:02 And does that expect to increase over time? Or is it expected to decrease or slowing growth? You want to identify the key players and their market share. 1:14 In terms of fast food, you could say, you know, and these numbers are made up, but maybe McDonald's makes up 60%. 1:21 Of all fast food and Burger King Burger King makes up 10%. You want to understand this. So if the main competitor is McDonald's, you're really trying to compete maybe with McDonald's. 1:35 Or you want to win out over a couple of the smaller competitors to increase your market share. So if the main competitor is McDonald's, you're really trying to increase your market The next one is you want to investigate what are the competitors that we have? 1:45 What are they actually offering? What are their products? What is the nuances with them? So you want to study these features, the functionality that goes along with these features, and also how they actually are pricing. 1:55 What different models are they using? What levels of pricing do they have? What are their features, etc. Are they subscription based? 2:03 In a future module we'll go through all the different pricing methods and setups that you could have. But you're going to want to understand this for your competitors. 2:12 You're going to want to look in their user reviews, their ratings, and their feedback. So if it's an app, the app store is a great resource. 2:19 Otherwise there's lots of reviews. If you're a customer who's online and read it, what are people actually saying about the competitor? 2:25 Is their positive sentiment, negative sentiment? You want to analyze their marketing and messaging as well. Their marketing and messaging can tell a lot about their strategy. 2:35 Because these are the things that they as a company have decided they want people to know about them. And so you, You can learn a lot from what they're actually putting onto Facebook and putting onto Google, etc. 2:46 And then finally you can use different competitive analysis frameworks. I won't go into all these, but these can help you better understand how you fit in to the competitive landscape against other competitors. 2:57 So you could do a swap analysis, you could look at Porter's Five Forces, or do a, feature comparison matrix to better understand if you have a feature versus whether or not a competitor has a feature. 3:09 You want to benchmark and measure performance. So establish performance metrics. You want to understand what are the relevant KPIs for your product and industry, and compare your performance against competitors. 3:22 Sometimes this is very difficult to do, um, because the data from another company may not be public, but if it is, you can compare how your product is doing against theirs. 3:32 And then number two here, you want to monitor how this changes over time in the competitive landscape. So you want to track, uh, competitors, product updates, different launches. 3:42 Different trends, different new players in your market. You want to see, um, how your product is performing over time in comparison to other competitors. 3:53 Um, in terms of leveraging competitor insights, uh, number one here is you want to identify the competitive advantages that you have over another product. 4:03 So what is your, what sets your product apart from others? What unique value proposition and differentiator do you have? And maybe you should really lean into that. 4:14 Um, is it strong? Is it not strong? How could you make it stronger, etcetera? Uh, number two, you want to use these competitive insights to inform products. 4:22 Uh, number three, you want to use these competitive insights to inform products. Um, and number three, you want to use these competitive insights to inform products. 5:02 What are the next set of challenges and problems that your customers face? And how can you build solutions based on them? 5:09 Uh, you want to be proactive here. Um, it's, you know, a common to see, uh, existing, uh, competitors who have a lot of market share, eventually lose out on that market share because they're not proactive. 5:21 They're not thinking ahead. Uh, they're not trying to stay competitive. They get complacent. Um, so you're going to want to keep this in mind for sure, uh, as you're going through prioritizing your roadmap. 5:32 Okay. In terms of examples here. So example one could be ride sharing. The competitors in this space are huge Uber lift and maybe some local ride sharing services like via in New York City. 5:45 And you want to analyze the competitive landscape for these ride sharing apps. So what are the feature set that they all offer? 5:52 What is the pricing that they offer? Um, are there small nuances here? Uh, you, you want to assess whether or not there are different strengths or weaknesses in the user experience coverage and customer service. 6:04 So maybe Uber is really good about customer service and making sure that their, their passengers have everything they need. Whereas Lyft is deficient in this area and has low customer service satisfaction readings. 6:17 And this could present as a great opportunity for Lyft to improve their market share by improving customer service. You could leverage a SWOT analysis to understand what are the market opportunities and threats here. 6:30 Number two, the second example here could be looking at an email marketing platform product. So maybe you're developing a new email marketing product. 6:39 The main competitors here are going to be Mailchimp, Sendinblue, Constant Contact. Uh, as well as a couple others. In terms of how you may go about analyzing the landscape here, you could compare all the different product offerings that these, uh, email marketing platforms have, what the pricing is for 6:55 each tier, and what comes along with each feature set. You want to review what are people saying about the product. 7:03 Um, you know, are, are, do you see a lot of reviews for Mailchimp about a specific pain point, and can you build a solution to solve that pain point, and then market, uh, and, and really leverage that solution, um, to existing Mailchimp customers to win them over. 7:20 You may want to, uh, use Porter's Five Forces to determine, uh, the industry competition and profitability. So those are just a couple of, uh, ways and examples of, um, doing competitive landscape analysis. 7:33 Okay, so in summary, understanding the landscape of your, uh, competitors is really important to make informed decisions about what should be worked on next, uh, in your roadmap. 7:43 Uh, It helps you create successful, effective strategies and it, it encourages you and kind of forces you to continually innovate and improve your product over time. 7:54 Um, you know, products, uh, get to be amazing because of competition, because they're forced to evolve and innovate and, and get, better and better. 8:05 So by being aware of all the different dynamics that go into your market, your specific niche, your industry and the competitors, PMs like yourself can better position your products for success and be proactive about what their customers actually need. 8:20 So hopefully that was helpful in understanding how you can apply competitive, analysis to your strategy and roadmap setting.","Learn how to analyze your product’s competitive landscape using research and frameworks so you can identify opportunities, refine positioning, and guide roadmap decisions.",89756168-46f8-4ea5-80f5-f9df5e84fb2c,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Understanding / analyzing competitors,3.5,TRUE,9,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:35.809593+00
05e3ee0e647a41a592820a95eb40c390,"0:01 In this module we are going to go over agile product development. So the first lesson here is agile methodologies and principles. 0:10 So, uh, an intro to agile. What is the definition? This is, this is a word that is thrown around a lot. 0:16 So hopefully in this lesson I'll break it down for you into actionable terms and ways you can understand it. So the definition of agile is that it's a set of values and principles for software development. 0:30 It is an iterative and incremental approach to product development as opposed to an alternative world where you might build an entire product. 0:40 Um, over five years and then release it. Um, and that's it. Um, agile, and I'll go into this in a minute, really emphasizes iterative and incremental improvements to the product. 0:53 So within the agile manifesto, um, there's a couple of components. One, individuals and interactions should be valued over processes and tools, um, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following the plan. 1:14 Um, the word inherently to be agile, to be fluid, um, means that we want to build software kind of in, in the way that makes the most sense and is, is the least rigid. 1:27 Um, if you're so rigid that you're sticking exactly to a plan, even if that plan no longer makes sense, you're obviously going to end up with a worse product in the end. 1:36 So agile, and I'll go into this, um, really emphasizes this, this being fluid. Um, and kind of having things in your process to get you there, but, but still you want to have this iterative approach to software development. 1:51 So there's a couple principles that I wanted to go through. One, prioritize customer satisfaction through continuous delivery of valuable software. 2:00 Continuous delivery meaning every day, every week, you're shipping new and new updates and new functionality in your software to welcome it, changing requirements, even late in development. 2:11 So as an example, say you have a project and you come up with all the requirements, you're working on it. 2:16 It takes a month. And in the third week, you find out that, hey, we, actually have this new insight that says that this specific part of the feature doesn't make sense anymore. 2:27 Um, obviously it would make sense to pivot that thing to be a better solution, even though we're close to when we said we would ship it. 2:36 Um, it's the third week out of four weeks. We want to welcome these changing requirements because if we don't, we're going to end up with software that just isn't the best. 2:46 Um, so we need to be agile. We need to be flexible evenly in development. Um, we want to deliver working software frequently, weeks rather than months. 2:54 It's similar to the number one, uh, collaborate closely with customers and stakeholders. We want to make sure that the software we're building actually works for real customers. 3:04 It's not just what we want, it's what our customers and stakeholders want. We want to build projects around motivated individuals and give them the resources they need. 3:13 So this is engineers on the team, designers on the team. Use face-to-face communication whenever possible. So, um, you know, one of the fastest ways to get unblocked when you run into an issue is to talk. 3:25 Um, you talk over video calls over phone calls in person, um, and you communicate. Uh, working software is the primary measure of progress. 3:34 So this is basically saying like at the end of the day what we are building here as product managers, as tech teams, is software. 3:41 So working software means we are progressing, uh, maintain a sustainable pace for the development team. We want to make sure that we are not burning out the engineers, um, that we are losing them and they're quitting their jobs because, uh, we're working, you know, we're, we're creating this environment 4:00 where we want to make, um, changes at a breakneck speed. No, we want to maintain a sustainable pace for the developers. 4:08 Um, strive for technical excellent, excellence and good design. We want to make sure that the software we're building actually works really properly. 4:16 It's using the latest, um, recommendations. It has good design, a good user experience, etc. Keep things simple and focus on what's necessary in the world of software development. 4:27 It is incredibly easy, um, to make a solution as complicated as possible from from in the background. So if you're developing a notifications system, if you think like about Facebook, for example, getting a notification or Instagram or any social media app, there is the easy MVP way to develop notifications 4:49 . And then there is an extremely complex way to create a notification system that can be plugged into from any different area of the app that has different time. 5:02 I'm related functionality that does tasks in the background, et cetera, that it's very easy to blow something out of proportions and out of scope. 5:11 So one of the principles here is to keep things simple, focus on what is necessary at the given point in time that you are working on this software, um, allow self organizing teams to make decisions. 5:22 So teams who own a specific product area should be able to make decisions by themselves. They, you know, within a tech organization, if you have five teams, there are hundreds of decisions being made every single week for the software. 5:37 Um, and you are going to be a major part of that decision making process. You're going to constantly be making decisions. 5:42 And so if you have a team, Agile basically says, okay, let the team make that decision. Finally, reflect regularly and adjust behavior as needed. 5:52 So teams can always improve over time. And it's important on a frequent basis to look back and say, okay, how did we do the past four weeks or the past two weeks? 6:02 What can we do? What are you doing differently? Um, can we have better documentation for JIRA tickets? Can we have better designs? 6:09 Can we have more in-person syncs? Whatever it might be to improve the ability for your team to execute. You want to do that on a regular basis. 6:18 Okay, so now I'm going to go into a couple different popular Agile methodologies. Scrum. This is a framework for managing complex projects or teams. 6:28 So there are some key components here. There's roles. So product owner, Scrum master, development team. There are artifacts, product backlog, sprint backlog, and increments. 6:40 And then there's events. More like things that happen. So sprints, there's sprint planning, a meeting, daily Scrum, sprint review. I'll go into this more. 6:50 Um, then there's Kanban. This is a visual workflow management system. As you see on the right, a Kanban board, um, basically has these four columns. 6:58 There's a backlog of prioritized work. There's the doing column. So that is what the team is doing right now. There's the review stage where the engineers might be reviewing each other's work. 7:09 And then there's finally the done column. So what are some benefits of agile methodologies? Number one, improved customer satisfaction, frequent feedback and collaboration and faster delivery of valuable features. 7:22 Um, this is probably a no brainer, but just to explain that no one wants to be waiting six months for their product to improve. 7:31 They want an improvement now. They want it tomorrow. Um, if you're waiting really long time to make something perfect, people are going to get impatient and actually leave your product for another. 7:42 Number two, I went into this before, but you really want to make sure that you're embracing change and responding quickly to anything that comes up. 7:54 There are so many things that come up during the development process, which is one of the exciting aspects about a product manager's role. 8:00 PMs are the person who has to deal with incontinence. There are upcoming requests, incoming problems, um, edge cases that we didn't think about three weeks ago. 8:09 And you want to manage this uncertainty, you want to manage this complexity, and you want to work with your team to come up with solutions and pivot. 8:17 There's basically never been a project or a feature that I worked on where it just went exactly perfectly as planned from beginning to end. There's always something that comes up and you want to embrace that, you want to accept that as a thing that just happens, and then move on from it. 8:33 Number three, higher product quality. Focus on technical excellence, good design, frequent testing, and continuous integration. So this is really saying, like, when we do our work, uh, as a product and engineering team, we want to make sure that the software we're building is really solid. 8:49 There are very few bugs, the, it makes sense intuitively from the user's experience lens, um, and we're frequently testing it to make sure that the flows are working properly. 9:01 Enhanced team collaboration and communication. Um, we want to empower teams to regularly reflect and improve on, uh, on themselves. So in summary, agile methodologies and principles, they really provide a really framework for product development. 9:17 It's, it's just a set of ideas and also these events and roles, which I'll get into in a bit. But by, by focusing, um, really on, on customer collaboration, this, this method of iteratively improving and progressing over time, um, it really helps product managers and dev teams to deliver high quality 9:39 products that meet customers needs. So hopefully that makes sense and I'll go into more about agile. In the, the next couple of lessons.","Learn how to apply Agile values, principles, and frameworks like Scrum and Kanban so you can deliver working software iteratively and respond to changing customer needs.",912633b0-eabb-420c-9fd8-49b78de56592,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Agile methodologies and principles,4.1,TRUE,10,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:36.400028+00
2613b3dfb97a491fb69a7e4596e582ef,"0:01 Welcome to Lesson 4.2. This one is going to be about Scrum framework. So introduction to Scrum. What is the definition? 0:09 So it's an agile framework for managing these complex projects and teams. It emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and this method of iteratively progressing over time. 0:20 So the first thing here is Scrum roles. So you might hear product owner. So a product manager on like a modern tech team in a more consumer facing company where the Scrum roles aren't exactly laid out like that, a product manager will typically do this. 0:40 They'll represent the customer and the stakeholders. They will define, they'll prioritize and they'll communicate what is on the product backlog. 0:48 And they will ensure that the team is always working on high value items. Um, I'll repeat this throughout the course, but the PM's role is really to make sure that everything that is being done on the engineering team, it has a high impact to the customers, the business, the engineering team. 1:05 Everything needs to be a high value project. Um, number two is the scrum master. So this will also be the PM or sometimes the tech lead will typically do this, but this person is ensuring the team is following scrum practices and roles. 1:19 So they'll facilitate scrum events. They will remove impediments and coaches. Uh, they will coach the team and then we have the dev team. 1:26 So this is the cross functional team responsible for actually delivering the work testing increments of the product. They will collaborate when you do planning designing building and testing and and they self organized to complete these tasks and make decisions. 1:43 Okay. So what are some of the artifacts that come along with Scrum? So one of the biggest ones is the product backlog. 1:50 So this is an ordered list of features, different enhancements that can be made or bug fixes for the product. This is a long list, sometimes hundreds of tickets long, uh, but we, we try not to have it be that long. 2:02 Uh, but this is an ordered list of, of different things that the dev development team can work on. So it's maintained and prioritized by the product owner in the, in this sense, the product manager you, um, it's continuously refined and updated. 2:15 So, um, things are getting added to the backlog, they're getting removed, they're getting put into the sprint. And so that brings us to the end. To the sprint backlog. 2:22 So the sprint backlog is the subset of the product backlog that is selected for a specific sprint. And I'll explain that in a sec, but dev teams plan and commit to this work, this sprint. 2:35 Uh, this is updated daily to reflect the progress and changes that have been made, um, within the last week. Um, or day increment. 2:43 So working tested and releasable software produced during a sprint, um, it represents the cumulative product progress and must meet the definition of done agreed upon by the team. 2:55 So definition of done is something that your team may want to come up with. Um, the technique may lead it. 3:01 You may lead it, but, um, it basically is almost like a checklist. Uh, in a sense, things that need to get done, um, to consider a project or a task complete. 3:13 So that means maybe it was tested, um, on multiple browsers. It was documented. It was communicated. There may be a list. 3:21 Where you want to get these certain things done to consider it done. Okay, so now we have Scrum Events. The Sprint is the, the, you know, penultimate, most important aspect of this. 3:34 So it's a fixed length iteration. Um, it's usually two weeks. Um, every team I've worked on, it's been two weeks. 3:41 It provi- but it could be longer. Um, it provides a regular cadence for delivering these product increments. Now, um, it doesn't necessarily have to be as strict as, okay, at the end of two weeks we release the product. 3:54 In, in reality what ends up happening is, um, teams will, if you're a web development team, um, and we'll get into that in the engineering lessons, you're gonna be releasing software basically daily if not every couple days. 4:07 Whereas if you're on a mobile team and you have to submit it to the App Store review, you may work on a two-week cadence where you will make a bunch of changes and then after two weeks submit it to the App Store and then you'll continue that cycle over and over again. 4:20 Um, it's time-boxed to ensure consistent progress. So, um, time-box in the sense that, okay, it is two weeks. If, if today's a Monday, it will end not this Friday, but next Friday. 4:31 Okay, sprint planning. So at the beginning of each sprint, the team will plan their, the work for the sprint. So the product owner, you, in this sense, and the developers, you'll collaborate to select and refine items from the backlog. 4:47 Uh, and then the dev team will commit to work they think they can complete during the sprint. So what ends up happening is you'll look at a specific ticket, um, a Jira ticket, which outlines like a feature or a bug or an update, and the developers will, will get together. 5:02 And they'll say, okay, I think this is three points of work. Um, and you may say, you may find that in your sprints with your team, your team can accomplish 30 points worth of tickets. 5:16 So okay, you, you have one ticket, it's three points. That means you have 27 points left for your sprint. You kind of iteratively go through the tickets and bring them into the sprint. 5:27 Um, and this is done differently on every team. Um, you really want to work with your engineers and the tech lead on your team to figure out what works best. 5:35 Um, and they'll definitely have some opinions on this. Okay, so a sprint is this two week thing. Um, sprint planning is at the beginning of the sprint. 5:45 Now we have daily standups. So these are short daily meetings. They're about 15 minutes long. Some teams do 30 minutes and they're with you and the developers. 5:55 Each team member goes around in this in the circle and really provides an update on their progress. What they did yesterday, what they plan to do for today and any blockers that are getting in the way. 6:06 So a blocker could be they need a decision made by you. That's a blocker that you can unblock. They may be waiting on another engineering team to work on a ticket so that they can implement their ticket. 6:20 That's a blocker and you can unblock it. You can help unblock it by talking to the PM of that team and saying, hey, when is this going to be done or really blocked here and kind of having those that cross team communication. 6:35 It helps maintain focus and transparency and fosters collaboration. So if because it's on a daily cadence, you're meeting every single day, like if someone is blocked on something you're going to find out pretty quickly and maybe another engineer or you have an idea on how we can move forward without 6:52 , um, and get through that blocker. We also have sprint reviews. So this is now at the end of the sprint. 6:57 At the end of that two weeks, we want to demonstrate the completed work. So it's the dev team, the PM, and stakeholders will review the increment, all the changes and provide feedback. 7:08 Uh, the PM or the product owner will update the backlog based on the feedback. Okay. And then we also have the sprint retro. 7:16 Um, so after the sprint review, the team will reflect on the sprint. So they will, you know, this is done in many different ways. 7:24 But independently, people will basically write down or they'll, they'll talk about it. Um, what went well, so within the last two weeks, what processes worked well or, um, where did we get lucky then what could be improved? 7:39 So where was there a slowdown? Where were we blocked? It's like what in our process isn't working right now? What can we do to improve? 7:47 Um, and then you identify actions for improvement. So you come out of that meeting and you have a list. You have maybe three things, um, where you say, okay, uh, in order to get better as a team, we are committing to doing this, this and that. 8:00 So it enables continuous improvement and adaptability. So all in all, Scrum provides a structured but flexible framework for managing projects and teams and, and dividing work into sprints and fostering collaboration and continuous improvement along the PM, the tech lead, the developer team, um, this 8:22 methodologies, it really helps to ensure efficient and effective product development over time. So hopefully that helps, uh, helps you understand Scrum.","Learn how to apply the Scrum framework by defining roles, artifacts, and events so you can plan and deliver work in iterative sprints with clear accountability.",4df01871-1c7a-40b0-b7ac-0c462c9a0aca,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Scrum framework,4.2,TRUE,9,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:36.984827+00
611811b1b0b3435db2c68eb2e7b1f4d3,"0:00 In this lesson, lesson 4.3, we're going to go over creating and managing the product backlog. So, intro to the backlog. 0:07 Um, what is the definition? We briefly touched on this in the last one, but it's a prioritized order list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes for a product. 0:18 Um, it's a single source of truth for the products, requirements, and it evolves and adapts to changes in the product's vision and user needs. 0:26 So, if you can imagine a very long list, it's obviously managed in Jira or a project management software like that, but there are tickets. 0:36 Um, and this is a list, a list of these tickets, and one ticket can be a new feature, or it can be an enhancement to an existing feature, or it can be a bug fix for one of the features that has been launched in the past. 0:49 And this is kind of within each ticket is the source of truth for what is required for that either feature enhancement or bug fix. 1:00 Okay, um, so characteristics of a good product backlog. Number one, it should be clearly defined items. So each item, each ticket is a ha- which is how it's usually referred to, should be concise and easy to understand. 1:17 Um, within each ticket, it includes a brief description, acces- acceptance criteria, and any necessary context. Um, and in the program, I give you a, um, JIRA ticket, uh, uh, template that you can use for this. 1:29 Um, number two is it should be prioritized. So the item should be ordered by priority based on factors like business value, customer needs, and dependencies. 1:39 So, uh, you wanna always make sure that the most important tasks are completed first, so they're at the top of the product backlog. 1:46 So, this is really your job. Your job as the Product Manager is to make sure that the team is working on high value stuff. 1:53 How does the team know that they should work on high value stuff? Well, they should just go to the Product Backlog, they should look at the top, and the most important thing is the product backlog. Or, and things should already be at the top. Refinement. The Product Backlog should be regularly refined 2:10 and updated. It involves adding new items, updating existing items, and removing obsolete items. So, over time, when you start your job, unless it's a brand new team which is unlikely, you'll probably already have dozens or hundreds of tickets in the backlog. 2:21 And it's worthwhile to, on a regular cadence every couple months, go through this backlog and look for tickets that, or enhancements, bugs that are no longer relevant, maybe they were fixed already, maybe the feature is not a priority anymore, things change all the time. 2:37 And so your backlog should be regularly refined and groomed. It's important to make sure that it is still the best representation of what is most high value for your team to work on. 2:49 And then also, everything should be estimated. So each item should have an estimation of the effort required to complete it. 2:56 It helps the team plan and prioritize their work. So I went into this in the previous lesson, but each ticket, each chunk of work should have a size that is agreed upon by the team of how much effort, how complex or how much time it should take to get that ticket done. 3:14 The engineers on your team are really going to be the ones who have the strongest opinions about the method of sizing and you should work with them. With your team and your tech lead to define this, um, a common one is the Fibonacci sequence. 3:27 So the team may point things on a one, two, three, five or eight and a one is something that's pretty easy to do. 3:35 Like they can do it pretty quickly, they understand exactly how it should be done and it shouldn't take much time. 3:40 Um, a five is like pretty complex. Um, there are unknowns there and that, that may end up taking several days. 3:48 And an eight is considered very complex. This is going to take a lot of work to understand the problem, understand how to make it done, get it done. 3:58 There may be unknowns that come up and block us. And so you'll work with your team to define the best sizing. 4:05 Um, but ultimately it, it goes back to, okay, how much do we think we can get done in a sprint? 4:11 Do we think we can get done 40 points, 30 points, 50? Um, after several sprints, you'll actually know this number. 4:19 You can just look back and see. Okay. Um, so. Sprint one, we completed 45 points worth of tickets. Sprint two, we completed 50 points. 4:28 Uh, sprint three, we completed 47. Okay. On average, we complete about 47 points worth of tickets. So for next sprint, let's plan up to 47. 4:39 Um, this is, uh, basically Take care. The work we're committing to doing, we can communicate this out to stakeholders and say, Hey, like we've sized everything. 4:49 We, we know all the work that's going to the sprint. We believe that it'll get done by next Friday. Um, so all that goes into creating a really good, strong product backlog. 4:59 Um, so, um, or, or characteristics characteristics of a good backlog. How about creating the product backlog to begin with? So this is, you know, everything about being a product manager, but you want to identify user needs. 5:16 So going back to previous modules, you're using market research. You're using customer feedback. You're using stakeholder input. To identify customer needs and pain points, and then solutions to those pain points. 5:28 You generate backlog items. So you break down those user needs into small, manageable items. You're writing user stories, you're writing bug reports, and other types of backlog items. 5:40 Then you prioritize. So you work with stake. So you take them to stakeholders to prioritize those items based on different factors, like business value. 5:48 Okay, if we complete a certain ticket, will this earn the business more money? Will customers be retained? Will we reduce the amount of people that are reaching out to our customer support team? 5:59 Customer impact and dependencies. These are factors that Thank you. Um, you will go into later as well, but that help you understand how we should actually prioritize this backlog. 6:08 Um, and then you continuously update it and then estimate effort. So, um, planning poker is, is where everyone in the room, um, will, uh, you'll, you'll go over the ticket and then everyone will mark down, write down either on software. 6:23 On paper, the amount of points that they believe that ticket, um, uh, is, is worth in terms of effort. And then, uh, there will be a countdown and then all the points will be revealed. 6:35 So one engineer might say two points, uh, two more engineers might say three points, one engineer might say one point. 6:42 Um, so. Now you're gonna have a discussion. Okay, we have a one, we have two, two, uh, one two and two threes. 6:49 So I think that's what I said. So it's like, okay, let's, we can either average it, add a two, or should we make it a three? 6:57 Let's chat through that. And then the group comes to consensus on what, uh, number of points there should be for a particular, uh, ticket. 7:07 So in summary, by creating and managing a well-structured backlog, the product manager in this, in this case, ensures that the dev team is always working on the highest priority tasks and they're well aware of what can be completed in a sprint. 7:23 Um, this helps the team deliver a product that meets customer needs and creates value for the business. Um, I'm going to, you know, continually reference that, those are really important aspects of the PM's role. 7:33 Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to create, prioritize, refine, and estimate a product backlog so you can keep your team focused on high-value sprint work.",6d76a014-6e63-4512-b1a1-0e2eb8e7701d,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Creating and managing the product backlog,4.3,TRUE,8,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:37.426998+00
1cb97c605b8843e59a9a780415b90045,"0:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over sprint planning and sprint reviews. OK, so we're going to explore the importance of sprint planning reviews. 0:10 And these are two meetings that are pretty essential for setting the team's goals and aligning their work with the ultimate product vision that you've come up with. 0:20 So what is the purpose of both of these? And we've kind of touched on these, but to reiterate, sprint planning is when you set the team's goals and select the backlog items to work on during that two week sprint. 0:33 And then sprint reviews happen at the end. So you want to inspect the work completed during the sprint and adapt the backlog based on feedback. 0:40 In that meeting. So let's dive into sprint planning. Who is in sprint planning? The product owner or product manager the scrum master, which is probably you or the tech lead and then the development team. 0:51 So those are the engineers. In terms of preparation, you want to refine the product backlog. You want to make sure that the highest priority items are sprint. 1:00 Ready. Then in sprint planning, you're going to review the backlog. You're going to define the sprint goal. So the sprint goal could be say, okay our goal is to ship an onboarding flow, a new onboarding flow for our users. 1:14 Okay. That's very clear. Everyone now knows our goal for the next two weeks is to ship a new onboarding flow. 1:21 Okay. Estimate the capacity of the development team. So, okay, we have five engineers. Oh, actually, this week you know, Tom is going to be out for three days. 1:30 So we need to deduct three days worth of points from our, from our planning process. And then you select the backlog items for the sprint and you create the sprint backlog. 1:41 So this is the set of tickets that are selected for that sprint that the engineers will then start working on. 1:48 In terms of best practices, you want to keep this meeting time boxed. This usually takes like 30 minutes to an hour depending on your team and how big it is. 1:57 You want to encourage collaboration and open discussion. So if some ticket comes up that is being discussed and there is a value pointed at it. 2:06 But you know, someone disagrees. You want to make sure that there's space for that. You want to make sure engineers feel empowered to speak up and you want to make sure everyone has a clear understanding of the goal and the selected items that ultimately map to that goal. 2:21 So every ticket in the sprint should ideally relate to the goal at hand for the sprint. Okay, now the two weeks are up let's do a sprint review. 2:31 So the purpose here, we're going to, we're going to take a look back. And in this meeting, we might want to gather feedback from stakeholders. 2:39 So depending on if you're, if your team does. Want to do this or not, you may invite a business stakeholder or someone from marketing. 2:46 And you're going to be demoing basically and going through the work that has been completed. So it's basically everyone from the sprint planning, but also different stakeholders from across the company. 2:56 To prep, you want to make sure that different things features that have been worked on are. Demoable. Your engineers are the ones who will probably be demoing. 3:06 So in terms of your role, you might want to message and say, Hey, Tom I know you were out for three days. 3:13 Can you it looks like you completed these three tickets. Can you demo those during our sprint review? And you want to then also gather data on the sprint progress and accomplishments. 3:25 So if you launched something big or you had a specific win, you want to gather that and prepare. So within the actual sprint review, you're going to review the goal. 3:34 So you can say, okay, we had the goal of shipping a new onboarding flow. Now you're in a demo, the completed work. 3:40 So what goes into the onboarding flow? So you might have a demo of the front end, which we'll get into with engineering the front end components, and then someone else might be demo the backend. 3:51 So they'll, they'll screen share the database table that is being updated when users go through the onboarding flow, or maybe you have an email that is automatically sent out. 4:02 So someone will demo the email, he'll discuss what went well, what could be improved. He'll gather feedback from stakeholders who, you know, on the marketing team or the sales team, they may have feedback and then you'll update the product backlog based on that feedback, if applicable 4:18 similar best practices here, you want to keep the meeting time boxed, you want to. Courage discussion, especially from the stakeholders and then use write down everything that you're getting in terms of feedback from those stakeholders and incorporate it into your backlog if it makes sense. 4:33 So in summary, the sprint planning and review meetings are really important for setting the team's goals, aligning their work and making sure you're, because continually improving, demoing, shipping features and incorporating feedback from stakeholders. 4:48 Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to run sprint planning and sprint reviews so you can set sprint goals, select backlog items, and adapt plans based on stakeholder feedback.",dbe38129-6a10-4fa6-b1d5-edbc37d385ab,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Sprint planning and review,4.4,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:37.989342+00
16e0d57a09704b6d91adf5837343dd71,"0:00 In this lesson, I wanted to go over a fun Agile story, kind of to demonstrate this somewhat vague concept of Agile into an actual story of a real team. 0:11 So once upon a time, a thriving tech company called InnovateX, there's a dedicated team that was tasked with creating a new cutting edge fitness tracking company. 0:23 The team consisted of a product manager who also took on the responsibilities of the product methodologies to enjoy to make sure it was a success and deliver the best possible product to their users. 0:45 At the start of the project, the product manager, Sophia, she collaborated with stakeholders to define the product vision and objectives. 0:53 What are we trying to get out of this product? She then worked closely with her team to prioritize the features and initiatives for the app. 1:00 So together, Sophia, the PM, the designer, and the engineers, they created an extensive product backlog detailing all the desired features and their relative importance. 1:12 So there were the p0, highest priority ones, tickets, there were p1s, p2s, p3s, p4s, etc. So Sophia now acting as the scrum master, she facilitated a sprint planning session where the team agreed on the goals for their first two week sprint. 1:28 They selected several high priority items from the product backlog and broke them down into smaller manageable tasks. So these are features that the team said, okay, to accomplish this feature, we want to make these five tasks that'll be available. 1:41 Build into that feature. Okay. The team committed to completing these tasks within the sprint timeframe. So each day the team participated in a daily standup meeting. 1:50 As, as seen in the photo here, they shared updates on their progress. They discussed any challenges and received support from Sophia and their colleagues. 1:58 So maybe a blocker came up and Sophia was able to after that meeting then message another product manager within the team to get something unblocked. 2:08 The, the daily communication helped the team stay aligned and focused on their sprint goals. At the end of the sprint, Sophia led a sprint review. 2:17 The team presented their completed work to stakeholders. They received valuable feedback. And they also conducted a sprint retro to discuss their successes, challenges, and opportunities for improvements in kind of more an internal setting. 2:30 Armed with this knowledge, the team adjusted their processes and set new goals for the next sprint. So over the next course of several months, the team continued to follow Agile process. 2:41 Over the course of iteratively delivering features and improvements every two weeks in these two-week sprints, they made data-driven decisions and continuously incorporated user feedback to ensure that the fitness tracking app met the needs of its target audience. 2:55 So through agile approach and close collaboration, the Innovate X team successfully launched this fitness tracking app, delivering a product that not only met but exceeded their users' expectations. 3:09 So hopefully this story showcased to you the power of agile methodologies in bringing a team together, enabling them to ship impactful features really quickly. 3:23 So, all in all, agile is a framework. It's a set of values. There's different things within it like sprints and backlogs and sprint planning. 3:34 All these things go together to make sure that your team is consistently making progress towards their goals. Towards the vision, whatever the vision may be. 3:45 So yeah, hopefully that helps paint a picture of how agile can help really transform and make your engineering team effective in their roles. 3:54 Let me know if you have any questions.","Learn how an Agile team uses backlogs, sprints, standups, reviews, and retrospectives to iteratively deliver features so you can apply Agile to ship improvements quickly.",9b310c99-de9e-4eed-8b0e-3e62115c596f,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,An Agile Story,4.5,TRUE,4,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:38.435173+00
966b67fbb9264825b87b5ed1d3a066c9,"00:01 Hello and welcome to Module 5. This is going to be about product design and user experience. So to dive in, principles of user experience design, otherwise known as UX. 00:12 So we're going to explore the principles of UX. A critical and really important aspect of product management that focuses on creating products that are easy to use, engaging, fun, and meet users' needs. 00:27 User experience design involves understanding how people interact with a product, and it optimizes the design to really create this seamless enjoyable experience. 00:36 As a PM, having a good understanding of these design and principles. It's going to be really important because it's going to help you collaborate with designers and ensure that your product delivers a delightful experience to its users. 00:48 So I'm going to now go through several different principles of user experience design, kind of best practices, and explain them as I go. 00:56 So number one, this may be one of the most important. Clarity and simplicity. The design of your product should be simple, clear, and easy to understand. 01:07 Users should be able to quickly grasp the purpose of the product and learn how to use it without much effort. 01:12 To achieve clarity, use familiar design patterns, clear typography, and concise copy. So, as you see, the good news is that the Google homepage landing page has not changed in a very long time. 01:25 It is literally the Google logo and the search bar, and then Google search and I'm feeling lucky. It's very simple, it's clear, it's well known at this point, and it's a perfect example of clarity and simplicity. 01:41 You really don't want to make your products overly complex, unless they need to be. You know, the only complex products out there should be ones where the task at hand is extremely complicated. 01:54 Like, for example, if you are trading stocks and day trading, and there's a number of different things that you want to know about the stocks and you could do with the stocks, adding two lists and setting different sell patterns and all that type of stuff. 02:10 That is a really complex interface. And so the experience should be somewhat complex if you're building for a really advanced trader. 02:21 However, as you've seen with Robinhood, they said, okay, most people actually aren't don't need any of that functionality. They literally just want to invest in stocks and they made it super simple and clean a clean, easy to understand interface to trade stocks and buying sell stocks. 02:39 Okay, moving on feedback. Provide feedback to users about the results of their actions. So this can be visual. So when you hover over a button, it highlights it as it's selected. 02:52 So as you can see up here when I'm when I'm hovering over the X, it's now highlighting. It's changing. That is a specific thing that needs to be built. 03:03 Unfortunately, it doesn't come. It just doesn't work like that immediately when you're building a product. When you hover over these things, these are these are all interactions that an engineer has built. 03:14 And and so you need to prioritize that in your product backlogs. It can be auditory. So a sound indicating action was successful. 03:23 So that it may be you know, useful on a desktop or a laptop computer, but more so maybe on a phone or a haptic vibration. 03:32 So this is really, really big on the iPhone. So different vibrations when a user does certain things on the phone. 03:40 An example is when you send a message. On WhatsApp, you see check marks indicating that your message was sent and delivered. 03:47 This feedback helps users understand the status of their messages. On the right here, you see in Netflix, and when you're hovering over one of these tiles, it, it auto expands which is giving you the feedback that hey, you are interested in. 04:01 In. Ozark right now. I think that's Ozark. And, oh yeah, it's Ozark. And then you can click play, you can do other things with it, but it's giving you that visual feedback and sense that you are doing the right thing, you're on the right track. 04:17 Okay, responsiveness. So, you want to ensure that your user interface is designed. To adapt different screen sizes and devices providing a seamless experience across any different platform. 04:28 So your engineers and your designers will implement a fluid grid design, it'll be flexible, it'll have flexible images, the CSS media queries and it'll all create a consistent and enjoyable user experience. 04:43 So this is a really good example on the right of Apple's website on, on desktop or on a laptop. As you can see the iPhones are laid out horizontally and you see at the top there's the navigation bar with all the different buttons that you can click. 05:00 Now, on mobile, if they tried to fit all those different things at the top, it would be a horrible experience. 05:07 So what they did is they created this little hamburger icon and when you click that there, it opens the menu and expands. 05:14 Also if they tried to squeeze this horizontal phone these four phones onto this display in that manner it would be pretty small. 05:23 It wouldn't fit the screen. So what they did is they put the phones in a different orientation in a different direction. 05:28 It's still conveying the same thing. So you still have the black iPhone with the three cameras. You have this blue iPhone with the call except deny, and you have those other two colors. 05:40 So it's all the same kind of content. It's just packaged in a different way. And you want to make sure that the products you're building are, are really responsive in this manner as well. 05:51 Another one is consistency. So you want to maintain a consistent design throughout the entire product to create a seamless experience. 05:59 Consistency includes visual design elements like color, typography, the font, layout, and different interaction patterns and language. So, for example, right here you see 69 reviews. 06:12 If on another place you said 69 ratings, that would be confusing. What's a rating versus a review? You want to make sure the review, the word reviews is consistent. 06:23 All over the place. Another example, Apple's iOS ecosystem ensures that apps follow a consistent design language, making it easy for users to navigate and use multiple apps on their device. 06:34 So if you click on a list, the list might appear in a similar format. Next, flexibility. So, you want to design the product. 06:43 To accommodate a variety of user preferences and abilities, offer different ways to complete tasks and consider different device types, screen sizes and input methods. 06:52 So Google Maps, for example, allows users to actually click a speech button to search for directions using text input voice commands, or sorry, in this case, voice commands. 07:03 Voice commands, or text input, or by tapping on the map. So it provides flexibility in how users actually interact with the app. 07:11 It doesn't let them just do it in one rigid way. If someone wants to use voice, they can. If they want to type, they can. 07:19 Efficiency. So you want to optimize the design to enable users to complete tasks. Quickly and easily. Remove unnecessary steps, streamline processes, and provide shortcuts for frequent actions. 07:31 It's pretty well known within the industry that if you have a specific form or flow that has, say, ten steps and each one is individually laid out versus condensing that down to three, more people are going to complete the version with three steps versus ten steps. 07:47 Because it's just easier, there's less friction. A great example of this is Amazon's Buy Now button. It allows users to purchase a product directly from that product description page without going through the entire checkout process, which for Amazon users is largely inefficient. 08:03 Because most of the time, all the information is staying the same. The delivery, the shipping address, the payment method, the time that it takes in terms of the shipment method that you select. 08:16 All that is staying the same. So what they did is they put it into one button, Buy Now, and it pops up emotionally. 08:23 It will write on that screen. You don't have to leave and you can check out. In certain cases with certain like ebooks, they have one click Buy, where you can literally click that button and it purchases it. 08:34 Streamlining the entire process. Amazon of course has better sales because of that. Error prevention and recovery. So anticipate potential user errors and design the product to prevent them. 08:46 When errors do occur though, provide clear guidance to the user on how to resolve them and allow users to recover from those mistakes. 08:54 So this person is trying to sign into Google with test at gmail.com and, but Google couldn't find that account. What if, what if Google had not displayed anything, like if you click the next button, it just like unclicks and then nothing happens. 09:11 That is what a lot of products accidentally do. They don't handle the errors. So if when you click next and it Google can't find that email a lot of products like won't, won't highlight that in red. 09:24 They won't display couldn't find your Google account. And those are horrible user experiences because the user is now blocked. They have no idea what went wrong, how to proceed. 09:34 For all they know the website is completely broken. So when a user is inputting an incorrect password on a login screen, make sure to display a clear error message. 09:44 Guiding them on how to proceed and recover from the mistake. You'll find that basically any feature that you're making, you will need to build in and think about error prevention and recovery. 09:56 It's a core part of creating a great user experience. Emotional design. You want to create a product that evokes positive emotions in users. 10:04 By considering aesthetics, tone, and the overall user experience. So this is like an architecture kind of furniture website and as you can see already from the landing page, it's a very warm website. 10:18 It's aesthetically pleasing. The font is really nice and modern and the picture is used. In the. Products are also consistent and warm and have similar color tones. 10:28 This is, this is all intentional. Another example is the Headspace app. They, they use playful illustrations, friendly language, and soothing colors to create kind of this calming experience for users who are seeking relaxation and mindfulness. 10:43 Another one is visual. So when you're designing, you want to establish a clear visual hierarchy that guides users through the interface. 10:52 So using size, color, contrast, and white space, in this, in this case the white space is black based on Netflix to emphasize important elements and group related content. 11:03 So this is a good example. Sitcoms is in the biggest font here, and that tells to the user, okay, everything below me is witty sitcoms. 11:12 Okay, top picks for you. Now this is grouped together, so I know by looking at this that all of these here are top picks for me. 11:20 And then there's a clear line, and then featured for you today, and there's more down below. So, another, an example here, like utilizing larger font sizes for headings and smaller sizes for body text to establish a clear hierarchy in a webpage is just one example of creating a really great visual hierarchy 11:39 . This is really important in lists and different forms. And in general, like this is a really important aspect of making it easy for a user to come onto a page like this and like within a second, split second, understand what's going on. 11:56 Another one is typography. So you want to choose legible and easily readable typefaces for your product, limit the number of different fonts used in the design. 12:05 And maintain consistency in font sizes. On, on, on the right here, you can see the weather channel. They're using a modern sans serif font for body text and a complementary serif font for headings to create this visually appealing typography system. 12:25 Color and contrast. You want to use color and contrast to effectively draw attention to important elements and improve readability. You want to ensure that there's sufficient contrast between text and background colors, especially for users with visual impairments. 12:40 So as you can see here, Apple has decided to make the background of this, this section black. And they're using this white font, this blue and this, this red. 12:50 Those are all colors that are easily readable with black as a background. But if they had chosen a like dark gray, it might be very difficult to, to actually read that text. 13:02 Another example is like, if you have a yellow background, and you put red text, and it's really small, it may be very difficult for a user to actually read that. 13:11 And, and that's a horrible user experience. You never want a user to be straining when they're trying to read the screen. 13:18 All these slides, white and black, that's black and white, white and black, that's obviously the, the, the most common pattern that you'll see. 13:25 Across the internet but it's because there is strong contrast. It's very, very easy to read this because of the font color is chosen. 13:35 White space white space is a really big one, so you want to make effective use of white space or negative space to create a clean, uncluttered layout that helps users focus on the content. 13:46 It can be used to separate elements, group related content, and improve readability. So as you see on the right there's a ton of white space here and here and here and here and then also in between each of these. 14:00 They could have easily made this one line where, see how it cuts off at ten quarters. They could have made that text go all the way there and they could have made this cell like very small and then no space in between, but they didn't because it's much harder for us to parse out the differences if there's 14:22 like a bunch of text all scrunched together. So by adding a lot of white space here, space and negative space and, and, and spacing these out consistently, you're able to tell easily the differences between these. 14:35 Like just by scanning. Okay. 16 core, 19 core, 30 core, 38 core. That's easy to understand. 10 core, 12 core, 12 core, 12 core, 300, 500, 700. 14:45 These are now one. Really easy to see in this list format because their use of their use of white space and negative space icons and imagery, you want to use high quality, meaningful icons and images that compliment your content and enhance user understanding. 15:02 Make sure the icons are consistent in style and size throughout the product. So Apple probably tested a bunch of different options here and they, they, they know that this is the best way to represent an iPhone and this is the best way to represent a watch and throughout their product, they're going 15:18 to use the same icons. They're not going to have a watch icon here and then a different altogether watch icon somewhere else. 15:25 They're going to be consistent and use these throughout the product. Additionally, design for multiple interaction types. So keep in mind that users may interact with your product using various input methods like touch, mouse, keyboard or voice. 15:39 So you want to design your UI to accommodate these different interaction types and ensure a usability for all different types of customers. 15:46 In this example, the customer is hovering over printers and scanners but sometimes you may be able to use your keyboard to actually go between buttons there. 15:56 Additionally, a user may be on their iPod, iPad, and they may be tapping printers and scanners. So you want to keep all this in mind. 16:03 So in conclusion, understanding and applying these user experiences design principles is really important for creating products that resonate with users, they meet their needs, they're easy to understand, they're easy to use. 16:14 The easier your product is to use the more successful it's going to be. As a PM, collaborating with designers and keeping these principles in mind will help ensure that you deliver an amazing product. 16:27 In the next lesson we'll go over wire framing and prototyping but hopefully this gave you a broad kind of understanding of what is good design and what makes good design in a product. 16:37 Alright, I'll see you there.","Learn how to apply core UX design principles like clarity, feedback, responsiveness, consistency, and error recovery so you can build products that are easier to use.",18aa8969-de61-4b63-a301-73d4ab8e8401,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Principles of UX design,5.1,TRUE,17,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:39.073508+00
75e3f47be36046b1985e594098572c9f,"0:01 In this lesson, I'm going to go over wireframing and prototyping. So these are two essential tools for designing and really refining the user experience of your product. 0:11 So as a PM, at least understanding the purpose and benefits of these two will help you collaborate with designers and stakeholders, ensuring that your product meets user needs. 0:20 I wouldn't say you necessarily need to be good at wireframing and prototyping or even do it at all. I personally have learned it over the years and do create wireframes and prototypes because I think it's really easy to, or kind of easier to visually express what I'm trying to communicate. 0:39 But you don't have to. Just having a close collaboration and relationship with your designer will get you most of the way there. 0:47 But regardless, what is wireframing? So wireframing is the process of creating a low fidelity visual representation of a product's interface, really focusing on like the layout, the structure, and the functionality. 1:00 They're like blueprints that outline the structure of the page or screen. They place key elements on the screen like navigation menus, buttons, and content areas. 1:11 So on the right is a great example of this. It is obviously not even close to a final product, but it's the overall screen. 1:19 So okay, it's clear there's four. Or menu buttons at the bottom. And there's two, maybe an input or buttons here. 1:26 And when you click this one, it goes here. It brings up that prompt. When you click here, it brings that up. 1:32 And so wireframes are just trying to visually communicate at a high level. What is the structure of our page? When you. 1:41 Click this. What happens? So what are the benefits? One, clarity and focus. They help designers and stakeholders focus on the core functionality and structure of the product without being distracted by any type of visual design element like color or typography. 1:58 Because when a designer makes a high fidelity design first, immediately the first reaction that anyone is going to have is to basically be on the visual stuff, not the actual structure or the layout or the visual hierarchy which is often times much more important to get right. 2:16 Number two, communication and collaboration. They provide a visual representation of the product. They can be easily shared and discussed amongst team members. 2:24 Like, if you go back here, everyone's going to understand basically what this means. It's not going to take a long time to communicate. 2:32 Like, when you click this it goes there because it's already done by the, by way of the wireframe. And then cost and time efficiency. 2:38 They're creating these wireframes before diving into high fidelity. Designs or development can help identify issues early on. So, if you're creating a whole new feature, you're going to want to lay out like a wireframe of how this leads to this screen and this screen leads to this. 2:54 And you might find that by doing that you missed something crucial. You need to add a button here or there. 3:01 And when design, when designers go into the high fidelity, high fidelity design process, what they are doing is they are working on designs and making sure they are pixel perfect and ready for implementation with the engineers. 3:16 And that is a very long and strenuous process. It's very detail oriented. It takes a long time. So if you can imagine when you are in the high fidelity phase, if something has to change, it's, it's really time consuming because you have to, you've already put in all this effort to make it pixel 3:34 perfect. And so it's better to find out those like big bigger flaws earlier in the process. By, by way of doing wireframes. 3:44 So an example of a wireframe for an e-commerce website might outline the placement of the main navigation menu, the product listings, the filters, and the shopping cart button. 3:53 Very basic stuff. And then later on with high fidelity, they will actually really design it out. Okay. Prototyping. Prototyping is the process of creating a functional interactive model of a product that allows users to experience and test it before it's actually developed. 4:10 So they can range from low fidelity like paper sketches to high fidelity. So going back to here, this would be an example of low fidelity. 4:19 But if you can imagine, a high fidelity prototype could be created where the designer has created basically pixel perfect designs and they put it into a prototyping software where if you go onto the page you can click on buttons and it will move and it will navigate. 4:39 And you can basically use the product as if it were really built in. Although it's not really communicating with the database you can't type anything in. 4:48 There are limitations to it, but it gives you a sense of, like, especially for an app but also websites. Like, what would it feel like to actually have this in my hand and scroll and tap? 4:59 Is this big enough? It's, it's, it's a way to get it into your hands and, and de-risk it, in a sense before actually having engineers work on it. 5:10 So, some benefits. User feedback. They allow you to gather feedback early in the design process, helping to identify potential issues and improve the product before the engineers work on it. 5:20 So, one example could be like if you're creating a list of something and you've been working on it on Figma, on the computer, and reviewing designs there, it looks fine, but then you actually get it onto a prototype on your phone and you see like the font is way too small, like everything is jam-packed 5:37 together on your phone, and for whatever reason you missed it when designing on the computer. If you've been able to identify these types of things before, the engineers actually go off and write code for that, because writing code for that, then finding out, then going back and doing it again, is going 5:53 to be way, way, way longer than a designer going back and updating the design to reflect the feedback. Validation, so testing prototypes. 6:02 With users can help validate design decisions and ensure that the product meets user needs. So, if you're unsure about how a feature should work, you could create a prototype, test it with users, and validate that, okay, this is a, this is a better method to, to perform this than, than another 6:19 one. And then lastly, stakeholder buy-in. So, interactive prototypes I think are typically pretty effective at helping stakeholders visualize the final product. 6:29 It makes it a lot easier to communicate your vision and gain their support. An example of a prototype for a mobile app might include interactive elements like buttons, sliders, and menus, allowing users to navigate through the app and test its functionality. 6:43 So in summary, wireframing and prototyping are two really great tools for designing and refining the UX of your product. As a PM, understanding the purpose and benefits will help you collaborate with designers and help, you know, help you have those intelligent conversations of, okay, it doesn't make 7:02 sense to create a prototype. We can prototype out of this and test it with users, or is it basic enough where we can just have the engineers work on it. 7:09 In the next lesson, we'll go over user testing and feedback, which ties very closely into this module, this lesson as well. 7:16 Alright, see you there.",Learn how to use wireframes and prototypes to communicate UX structure and test interactions so you can collaborate with designers and reduce rework before development.,7c1e07d6-dcb8-4f57-a32f-e18bcab890ce,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Wireframing and prototyping,5.2,TRUE,8,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:39.523188+00
a524bf61599c496eb7be9504c21eab9d,"00:00 In this lesson, 5.3, we're going to go over user testing and feedback. So user testing and feedback, they're really important parts of the product design process. 00:10 They help you understand as a product manager how your target users are going to interact with your product. It helps you identify these issues and refine the experience before it gets to the end. So we'll cover various types of user tests that you can do with your user base, provide steps for running 00:29 them, and then discuss how to analyze the results. There's two broad types of user tests. So there's moderated and unmoderated. 00:38 Moderated is walking through a set of questions for users live. This can be done in person or virtually. There can be a back and forth between the interviewer and the participant. 00:48 The main benefit of doing a moderated test instead of unmoderated is that you could dig deep into a specific problem area with follow-up questions. 00:57 So if you're having a user go through a new prototype and they stumble on something, you can immediately in the moment ask them like what were they thinking when they thought to click on that or what were they confused by versus unmoderated the user is using a platform to take the test and no one on 01:16 the team is there to intervene or ask questions. So there's no back and forth. But the major benefit of an unmoderated test is that you can run many of these at once. 01:24 So it's much more scalable. It doesn't require scheduling or your team members time, typically 30 to 60 minutes each to perform a test. 01:31 So you could do an unmoderated test with 20 participants and you just set it up, set it up to go 20 users completed. 01:41 And then you're able to run through all the results much quicker. So, um, there's pros and cons to each moderated and unmoderated. 01:47 So you'll have to figure out what makes, what makes sense for your product. Okay. Usability testing diving into the first one description here is that it involves observing users as they interact with your product to identify any issue. 02:01 Choose or areas of confusion. What are the steps? So one, you want to define what are the objectives for the test? 02:08 Why are we running this usability test? Next, you want to develop a test script with specific tasks for participants to complete. 02:16 For example, um, if you're, uh, Amazon, uh, and you're running a usability test. You probably want to have users start at the homepage and you say, find a pasta, uh, strainer, um, and they're, you're going to watch them and observe them as they go to try and find this. 02:34 Um, you want to recruit a diverse group of participants that represent your target users. So, if 90% of the participants, 90% of your target users are between the ages of 20 and 30. 02:45 Uh, it's not really beneficial for you to recruit a 85 year old person, uh, to test the product. You, you want someone within your target user range. 02:54 Then, conduct the user test, the usability test, either in person or remote. Observe the participants as they complete the tasks. 03:01 Then, when it comes time to analyzing the results, you're going to want to identify patterns and recurring issues. So if you do 10 usability tests with 10 users and 6 of them stumble on one thing, that's a clear, clear pattern and recurring issue. 03:16 And you should probably update that and then run a usability test again. So, after you do one, round of this, you'll make recommendations for improvement based on what you observe. 03:25 So an example here is testing the navigation menu of an e-commerce website to determine if users can easily find and access product categories. 03:34 So in the case of Amazon, you may say, you know, okay, go find pet food and they'll open uh, the navigation and if you see them taking a really long time to get to the pat pet category, that means you've done a bad job creating that navigation. 03:50 Okay. AB testing. This is another really great, very popular way to test um, user experiences. So it's also known as split testing. 03:59 It involves comparing two versions of a product feature or design element to determine which performs better. So you want to identify the element that you want to test, whether it's the button color, headline text, it could be a whole feature. 04:14 Um, so AB tests can be big or small. You'll create two versions with the variations, then you'll randomly assign users to see their version. 04:22 A or version B. The engineers are the ones that are going to be really involved with the random assignment of users. 04:29 Then you're going to want to track key metrics. So click-through rate, for example, what is the rate, the percent of users who actually click the button to the next thing? 04:39 Um, and then you'll look at what it is for both versions. So, say you have a page, um, like a checkout page, and there's a blue checkout button and a green checkout button. 04:50 And you see that in the version, version A, the blue one, you see 30% of users click that. And the green button you see 20% of users click that. 05:00 Okay, from this test we know the blue version, version A, is better. 10% more users click to checkout. So, we're going to ship that version to 100% of users because we have, we now have data, definitive data that shows that that design is better. 05:16 Even though we may have, we may have thought that green checkout version would perform better because green is associative. So, when analyzing the results, I kind of spoke to this, but to compare metrics for each version, you'll determine which one is performing better. 05:36 Another example is testing two different calls to action on a landing page to see which one results in more. So, you could have an input and the button says sign up, or the button can say get started. 05:49 And you're testing which one of these is better, which one resonates more with users. Tree testing, it evaluates the effectiveness of a website's info architecture by having users complete tasks using a simplified text-based version of the site structure. 06:04 So, steps to run here. You want to create a text-based representation of your website's hierarchy. You'll then define tasks for users to complete using the text-based structure and you want to recruit participants to do this. 06:18 So, here's an example of a tree test. An example question. Find available insurance plans that you can sign up for. 06:26 Okay. So, the user will click home, they'll click citizen, education, health, and wellness, and then get to insurance providers. Um, the next task could be find contact information for a government office. 06:37 Uh, that, that user may click government first. And you will be able to see these steps. That a user takes to get there. 06:45 And you'll be able to see the success rate as well. So, um, how to analyze the results of a tree test. 06:51 You want to measure the task completion rate, the amount of time it takes to complete tasks. So, for example, uh, find contact information for a government office. 07:00 Um, if I'm a user, I'm clicking government, and then there may be contact us, and now it's going to be very fast. 07:06 But for find available insurance plans, like what I know to click citizen, um, first versus like visitor or business, like probably not. 07:18 It's probably going to take me longer to complete question one. And that means I can do a better job as a product manager, um, categorizing insurance providers, um, in the product. 07:28 Um, and you're going to, through all of this, identify areas of confusion. So, um, another example here is testing the organization of a help center to ensure users can easily find information they need. 07:41 Uh, help centers are really important, creating a great product experience. And sometimes it's managed by the product team. Sometimes it's managed by the support team, but there's a variety of different ways that you can categorize, help content, articles, videos, et cetera. 07:54 And using a tree test can really help you get there. Another way is fake door testing. So fake door testing, it's a method of gauging user interests and a new feature by presenting users with a non-functional version of the feature and measuring their engagement. 08:10 So steps to run. You could create a non-functional version of the feature, like a button or link that doesn't lead anywhere. 08:16 You can integrate the fake door into the product and then you can monitor user interactions with the fake door. So as an example on the right, we have Apple Card. 08:25 This would probably never happen with Apple, but what they hypothetically could do is they could put this on their website, they could see how many people actually click apply now, and they can get a sense of like out of all the visitors to Apple, what percent might be interested in an Apple Card. 08:43 If they see that 1% is clicking or 0.5% is clicking, they're probably going to think, okay, this is probably not worthwhile for us, like, you know, this is either a bad product idea, we're marketing it, product marketing it in the wrong way, etc. 08:59 Or they may see 80% of people click on the Apple Card, and if Apple sees that, 80% of people are clicking on apply now. 09:07 Think about how many engineers and teams they're going to put on making the Apple Card a reality as fast as possible. 09:14 So, fake door testing is a really powerful tool, um, you know, it's in a way deceiving users a little bit, um, but you can do this in a seamless way and you get data to inform decisions about whether to develop a feature further. 09:30 So, another example is adding a non-functional save for later button on an online store to gauge user interest in a wishlist feature. 09:38 Again, it's, it's bad practice to have buttons which don't actually do anything or don't lead to anything, um, but you can do this in a way where you're able to still not really negatively impact the user experience but get this critical data which will help inform your roadmap. 09:55 Another way is card sorting. So card sorting is a technique used to understand how users categorize information. It can help inform the information architecture, also known as IA, and navigation of a website or app. 10:10 So what are the steps here? One, create a set of cards each representing a piece of content or functionality. Then you'll ask participants to group the cards into categories that make sense to them. 10:22 You could also have participants label the categories they've created, or you could create those categories to begin with. In terms of analyzing the results, you'll want to identify common patterns and how participants are grouping and labeling the cards. 10:36 This goes back to previous modules and lessons where you as a product manager may think that something makes sense to be grouped in a certain way, that you may find that 50 of your users think the opposite, think something different. 10:49 And what is going to be a better outcome for your product and for the business is what your users think, not what you think. 10:54 So have an open mind with this and utilize card sorting to get at this information. An example is conducting an open card sort with potential users of a fitness app to understand what's going on. And how they categorize different types of workouts and features. 11:09 So this is an example of what a card sort could look like. These are cards where you save fees, hauls, downloaders by perspectives, open days and users are dragging these and categorizing them all together. 11:23 Um, first click testing. First click testing measures where users click first when trying to complete a task. It helps evaluate the effectiveness of your interface and discover potential usability issues. 11:37 So you may prepare a set of tasks for your users to complete and then you use a first click testing tool to record where users click first when attempting to complete each task. 11:50 You'll recruit participants and have them perform the actions. When you're analyzing the results you'll review the click data to see if users are clicking on the correct elements. 11:59 So if you say like find about find information about the school and they're clicking the about button, but maybe they're clicking the wrong about button, that's an important point in your direction, a usability issue. 12:12 So you want to identify these areas where users are getting stuck or confused. Another example is running a first click test on a redesigned home page to determine if users can quickly locate the contact us button on page. 12:25 Beta testing. Beta testing involves releasing a really close near final version of your product to a select group of users for real world testing. 12:36 It allows you to gather feedback from them from a small group, identify bugs and make improvements before launching it to a wider market. 12:43 So Apple actually does this every single year. With their iOS releases, they create an iOS beta. They give access to all the developers and they're finding bugs there. 12:53 They're gathering feedback. So maybe the new the new clock app is not doing something right. So people are going to submit feedback from that. 13:02 They're going to take it in. They're going to fix it and then they're going to replace another beta version until it's basically perfect. 13:08 And then they're going to release iOS out to the entire world. So, um, I kind of gave you a full run now, but steps to run. 13:16 You want to develop a beta version of your product that's feature complete and stable enough for testing. You don't want to give something to users that's littered with bugs. 13:25 And clearly bad. You want to make sure it's close to being done. You'll recruit a group of testers, ideally representing a diverse set of your target user. 13:35 You'll provide them with access to the beta version. And you'll also give them a way to provide feedback. You'll collect the feedback and bug reports from the testers throughout the period. 13:45 Review the feedback and bugs to identify common patterns or areas of improvement. And if a bunch of people are reporting something was really difficult to use, it probably was difficult to use. 13:55 So prioritize and implement changes based on the feedback you received. An example is releasing a beta version of a new project management tool to a group of project managers and team members. 14:06 They'll test it, they'll give feedback before the actual official launch. So the importance of user feedback. Gathering feedback throughout the product development and design process is essential for a number of different reasons. 14:20 One, you can identify issues early and often. User testing can help uncover these users. It's great to validate that those are the right decisions. 14:46 We're not, um, you know, perfect. We make mistakes. So testing your product with real users can help ensure that your design decisions are effective and meet user needs and expectations. 14:57 Additionally, you can improve user satisfaction by continually iterating and refining your product based on feedback, you'll create a better experience overall. 15:06 Your users will enjoy it more, they'll, they'll like it a lot better and you'll have more loyalty and retention. And then finally, saving time and resources. 15:14 Identifying and addressing issues really can save time and resources by reducing the need to do extensive redesigns or bug fixes later on. 15:23 Um, as I mentioned, engineering and designers time. Um, is precious. You don't want to waste it. You don't want to have them think, do things over and over again. 15:32 So in conclusion, user testing and feedback are really essential components of the product design process that help ensure a successful user centered product by conducting a variety of these different tests for different features. 15:46 And functionality improvements, you can ensure that your product is both functional and enjoyable for your users.","Learn how to choose, run, and analyze user testing methods to uncover usability issues and validate product decisions before launch.",6fddfa27-248f-4d64-a96d-92b115d4cfbd,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,User testing and feedback,5.3,TRUE,16,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:40.007357+00
cf2e04d343464975b06eb681738413e2,"0:01 In this lesson 5.4, I'm going to go over accessibility and inclusive design principles. Okay, so I'll discuss the importance of really making sure that accessibility is, is at the center of a lot of the decisions you make, um, and inclusive design as well. 0:18 Um, and, and this ultimately allows you to cater to a diverse audience for your products. Okay, so understanding accessibility and inclusive design. 0:27 Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments that can be used by people with disabilities. Inclusive design is a broader concept that considers the diverse range of human abilities, preferences in situations when creating products or services. 0:46 So accessibility may be for someone who is deaf or blind, versus inclusive design may be for someone who can see, but can't see that well. 0:55 Or can hear, but can't hear that well. Or has processing issues, etc. So the goal is to create a product that can be used by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design. 1:09 So the importance of accessibility and inclusive design. It is not only an ethical responsibility, but also a legal requirement in many countries to make products accessible to people with disabilities. 1:21 Accessible and inclusive products can reach a larger audience, leading to increased customer satisfaction and business opportunities. Um, by considering accessibility from the beginning, you can save time and resources compared to going back and retrofitting an existing product. 1:35 So if you're building a new product or you join a team where the product is already established, you'll still want to make sure that accessibility is front and center of the decision-making process. 1:49 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, WCAG, I've heard this pronounced different ways, but this is a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C, to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. 2:05 The guidelines are organized under four main principles, perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Each principle is accompanied by a set of success criteria, which are testable statements that provide a baseline for measuring whether or not something is accessible. 2:21 So, to dive in here, perceivable. You want to ensure that users can perceive your content regardless of their sensory abilities. 2:30 So, um, if someone cannot see, you want to provide alternative text for images, captions for videos, and transcripts for audio content. 2:38 Operable. Make your product operable through very easy to use, like a keyboard, touch, or voice commands. An example here is use clear language, consistent navigation, and provide mechanisms to help users understand complex content, like a tool tip, for example, and robust. 3:13 You want to make sure the products that you're making can be reliably used by a wide range of technologies, including assistive technologies. 3:21 Semantic HTML elements and follow best practices for coding to ensure compatibility with screen reader, readers, and other assistive technologies. So this is going to be really important for your engineers to take note of, but it's also important that the product manager knows and the designer knows 3:37 that this should be front and center. When you're making a feature, you shouldn't just skip over this part completely. You should take it into account. 3:46 Um, it is a requirement. There are laws around accessible design for products. Um, inclusive design best practices. You want to design for different user abilities. 3:56 So consider the needs of users with varying abilities such as visual, auditory, motor, or We'll be right back. Cognitive impairments. 4:03 You want to design for different devices and contexts. So make sure your product works well on a bunch of different devices and platforms and in all different environments and situations. 4:13 So think about someone who doesn't have really strong internet connection. So it may load really, really slow for them. And make it almost unusable versus your engineers may, you know, because they have a high salary, they live in a good area, they may have internet that is 600 megabytes per second, 4:33 but your users may not have internet that fast. So think about these types of things. Involve users in the design process. 4:41 So when you're running user tests, include people with disabilities in the design process. You'll gain valuable insights from them and create more inclusive products because of it. 4:51 And again, continually test and iterate. You want to make sure you regularly test with your product with real users, not just yourself, including those with disabilities and make improvements based on their feedback. 5:02 So, in summary, by incorporating these accessibility and inclusive design principles into your product development process from the beginning, collaborating with engineers and designers, you can create products that cater to a diverse range of users, ensuring that everyone can enjoy and benefit from 5:19 your product, not just able-bodied We'll be right back.

b7b3112fb44b4e40bddd28445144ece9,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over best practices for PMs to work with designers. Collaborating with a designer if you're on a user-facing team is really critical. 0:10 So I'm going to go over how to effectively collaborate between these two functions. So number one is to establish clear communication channels. 0:20 Effective communication is the foundation of any successful collaboration between two partners. PMs should work with their designers to determine what is the preferred way to communicate. 0:30 Is it slack? Is it email? Is it video calls? Um, really figure out what works for your designer and conform to that. 0:36 You want to establish regular check-ins and meetings to discuss progress, share feedback, and address concerns. Maybe one of the worst things that could happen is if a PM and a designer don't talk for days at a time. 0:48 That would be absolutely horrible because lots of decisions will be getting made without the other's input. So, um, you want to have these regular check-ins see what's going on if there's anything that they're, they want feedback on, etc. 1:00 Set expectations for response times to maintain momentum and avoid misunderstandings. So, um, you may have to think in your head that a particular design may take 30 minutes to complete, but the designer might think it will take two hours to complete. 1:15 That's a kind of big difference and you want to be clear and upfront about these types of assumptions ahead of time, so you don't end up having misunderstandings with your designer. 1:26 And then also be really transparent with project updates and changes. This helps build trust and fosters a healthy working relationship. 1:35 If you find out about some change to your, to your project because of some, uh, new, um, user requirement from a stakeholder or something that came up with the engineers, you know, don't wait to tell your designer, be, be transparent, be communicative with them. 1:51 Um, they need to translate what you are saying is a user requirement into designs so the engineers can be unblocked and actually go and develop those. 2:01 You want to make a sure that you're developing a mutual understanding of roles and responsibilities. So to collaborate effectively, PMs and designers need to understand the differences, clarify who is responsible for what aspects of the project and respect each other's expertise and boundaries. 2:19 Um, the designer is not going to be stepping on your toes. Uh, when it comes to determining business value, whereas you should not be stepping on their toes when it comes to how something is designed, designed or like specifically looks, align on decision making processes to avoid conflict and ensure 2:35 smooth project execution, foster a collaborative environment where both of you could share ideas, feedback, and concerns openly and without judgment. 2:46 Um, in terms of defining project goals and scope, so the PMs and designers should work together to set measurable project goals that align with user needs and business objectives. 2:55 You want to outline the scope, including the exact deliverables, the timelines and resources associated. And identify any constraints, independencies that may impact the project. 3:06 Discuss challenges and risks, um, and prepare, start preparing for those roadblocks. Also, create a shared vision and design language. So, you want to develop a clear understanding of user needs and the target audience by conducting user research and creating these user personas. 3:21 This is something you want to do together with the designer. You'll establish design principles and guidelines to ensure consistency and usability across the entire product. 3:31 So, you're not always having to make decisions. You'll have these design principles that you stand by. You'll share inspirational references and resources to align on the desired aesthetic and experience. 3:41 And your designer will create a design system or a pattern library to streamline the design process and ensure consistency. So, if you have a button here, it's the same button there. 3:53 You have a primary button, a secondary button, etc. Foster a collaborative review and feedback process. So, you'll want to schedule a review. 4:02 Regular designer reviews and critiques to discuss progress and provide feedback. You want to offer constructive criticism and ask clarifying questions to better understand design decisions. 4:13 Never attack the designer's designs. That is a recipe for disaster. Always approach reviewing them, giving them with the benefit of the doubt. 4:22 High feedback that you're giving back to the user's pain point or business goals. Instead of just commenting on something and saying, you know, I don't like the way this looks, you could say this may seem confusing from the user's perspective. 4:37 And them receiving that That is a lot better than hearing You just say that you don't like, uh, you know, their design that they worked hard on. 4:46 So encourage open dialogue and actively listen to your designer to ensure all the perspectives are heard and considered and embrace these kind of iterative improvements and changes to refine the product over time. 5:00 Another thing you can do is plan and prioritize guys. Design tasks. So break down the project into manageable tasks and prioritize them based on user needs. 5:09 So instead of just trying to design the whole thing all at once, break it down into specific parts. So make it a lot easier for your designer to get started and get moving on. 5:18 Set realistic deadlines and buffer times to accommodate. And maintain a healthy work-life balance. So do this in tandem with your designer. 5:29 Say, what is reasonable to target for getting this feature designed? And if they say something that is outside of your expectations, say they say two weeks and you need something designed in one week. 5:42 Um, ask, like, what part of this do you think is the most complex? Like, one option here is to cut scope a little bit. 5:49 Like, we don't need every single feature here. Um, ideally we have this um, designed and completed by next Wednesday. Um, so I'm wondering like, what aspect of this is, is really uh, complex. 6:02 And they're gonna tell you. They're gonna tell you what they think. Um, they're the expert in design and you can work together to maybe cut scope and get something out faster. 6:11 Celebrate successes and reflect on challenges. So recognize individual and team achievements to foster a positive and supportive work environment. You want to share project successes with stakeholders to demonstrate the value of collaboration between PMs and designers. 6:26 Nothing that happens on a tech team is because of one person. It's always a team effort. A PM can't do anything without engineers and designers. 6:36 A designer can't do much without a product manager and engineers as well. It goes around. We're all interdependent on one another. 6:47 You want to conduct post-mortem reviews to identify areas for improvement. So going back to the scrum processes in Agile of doing retrospectives at the end of sprints, you could do post-mortem reviews with your designer as well. 7:10 So by following these best practices, you and designers can build strong relationships, you can streamline collaboration with one another, and ultimately you'll deliver a that really grew. 7:23 Great user-centered product that is super successful for the business.","Learn how to collaborate effectively with designers by aligning communication, roles, goals, and feedback so you can deliver user-centered products with fewer misunderstandings.",e46d10bc-6cc3-4f15-a392-29d92fae0c8b,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Best practices for PMs working w/ Designers,5.5,TRUE,8,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:41.85475+00
666e7558d556423caeb03330b587129c,"00:00 Hey there and welcome to Module 6. This is going to be engineering concepts for product managers. So let's dive right in. 00:07 So the first lesson here, 6.1, is going to be the software development lifecycle. So we're going to discuss what this is. 00:15 Uh, it's really a process that outlines all the different steps that are involved in developing software. This is all the way from the inception of the project, the idea of the feature, all the way to completing it at the end. 00:28 So this means delivering it to the user and having it be used by end users. So it's really important to really understand this entire process from beginning to end, especially the ways in which a product manager can collaborate with the engineers on their team. 00:46 Because at the end of the day, the engineers are the ones that are actually building what gets put in the hands of the users. 00:53 So you really need to understand how the process works, how to work with those engineers, so that you can go from the idea to actually launching something in the end and have it be successful. 01:05 So as I go through this, I'm gonna provide different examples hopefully to allow you to better understand the process. So a quick overview of the software development life cycle. 01:17 So it's really a structured process and it goes through a series of stages. These stages are pretty defined and pretty universal across different tech companies. 01:28 And the ultimate goal is that the software and features that are being delivered to the customers are really high quality in the end. 01:35 They meet their requirements and needs. They can be maintained. They are up and running and functional on a consistent basis, etc. 01:44 There's different models out there like waterfall agile and iterative approaches and they they have some small differences between those and I'll go over those in a later lesson. 01:55 Okay, so diving in here, these six phases, really that are important here, the first one being requirement gathering, second is around design, third is the implementation phase, four is around QA or quality assurance and testing, the fifth is deployment and finally six is maintenance. 02:13 So to dive into each one of these. So the first one is the requirement gathering, requirements gathering and analysis phase. 02:21 So at this point the PM is actually really important because they are working to identify the needs and requirements for the feature or product. 02:31 This means really getting in the weeds and understanding what do the users actually want to do. Like where is the data going to be stored, what data will there be, what will it look like, etc. 02:42 We're really focused on making sure that everything is outlined and defined so that the engineers can actually take that and run with it. 02:52 The engineers are really reliant on the product manager to actually define how some things in a work. If there's a designer on your team working with them to make sure they know how it's going to look and function. 03:04 and then from there they can actually go on and build it. So a quick example of things that a PM can do during this phase to really help out is conducting market research. 03:16 So learning like what is the market doing? What do users actually want? This may involve interviewing potential customers and users and getting them in the room or over-asume to better understand their actual needs. 03:29 And then eventually you're gonna want to collaborate with the developers to actually define the features. So the engineers on your team are going to be a really great resource to actually help you understand what can be built and how it can be built. 03:43 They oftentimes have better ideas actually than the product managers or the designers because they're in the code base. They really know the ins and out of how the product is actually built and working. 03:56 So they may think of an idea to do something even easier or faster or better than an idea that you may come up with. 04:02 The importance of this stage is that the accurate and comprehensive requirements are really essential for making sure that the product and features that we're working on are meeting customer needs because the biggest waste of time ever would be developing features over a long period of time that you 04:21 ultimately ship to the world and you find that no one's actually using them, it's not solving a user problem in a major way. 04:31 Engineers are typically the most expensive people at tech companies to pay and because of this we need to be really diligent about the work that we're actually having them do. 04:43 A couple of risks here. So inadequate requirements can result in a product that really does not address the user needs. 04:50 Again, leading to wasted resources, misdeadlines and low user satisfaction. So there's a bunch of different things that could go wrong if you don't do your due due diligence at this requirements gathering and analysis phase. 05:04 Okay, so the next one is the design phase. So the development team, the engineers are going to create a really detailed outline of the architecture of the actual feature. 05:15 So they're gonna work with you based on the requirements that you've gathered and outlined to actually write out in very specific technical terms how it's gonna work. 05:26 So what data do we need? What are the data models? how is it can all work together and what they typically do is then, you know, a main directly responsible individual, DRI, or project lead, will create a technical spec and they'll write it out from beginning to end. 05:44 They'll think through a lot of different challenges, problems when it comes to how they may need to build this feature. 05:52 And then what they do is they'll send it around to the other engineers on the team, as well as other engineers on other teams. 05:58 Basically, asking for comments and feedback about the proposal. Many different people get involved at this stage to make sure that we're actually implementing things in the proper way. 06:09 We're thinking about different dependencies, dependencies meaning maybe we're working on updating an area of the product that actually has code that impacts another area of the product. 06:21 So basically, we try to identify that and get the technical owner, like the engineers who own that other piece to weigh in on our proposal. 06:30 So they're really taking into account all the different things that go into this feature and how it's developed. An example of a couple of things that the PM can do during this phase is helping the designer create wireframes and mockups and the tech spec, giving feedback on the tech spec to really guide 06:46 this process. So it's not really expected that the PMs completely understand a hundred percent of what is in these tech specs But they should have a general understanding and review it with the project lead to make sure that the person who wrote the tech spec actually created it based off of a good understanding 07:07 of the requirements that you set It's you know possible and it sometimes happens that an engineer won't fully understand the requirements that you write And so the tech spec that they create maybe a little bit off from what you actually would expect So it's important to like read these tech specs and 07:24 Collaborate with those engineers around what they're actually proposing So the importance at this stage is that a really well-defined design really make sure that the dev team has a clear understanding of How the product is going to be architected how the user interface is going to function what data 07:42 models are going to be involved in this update or feature and it really helps things move, you know, smoothly throughout the dev process. 07:52 Couple risks here. So an incomplete or unclear design spec can really lead to confusion amongst team members. So if you're not very clear about how something work is going to be working, the engineers are going to have questions for you. 08:08 It's going to cause a lot of friction and back and forth. So make sure that when you're actually writing the requirements in the previous phase, you're being really detailed and you're thinking through all the different questions that they may have. 08:20 You want to really consider like when you send out the requirements to the engineer, they're coming into it with zero understanding, zero context. 08:29 So come from that mindset of, okay, I received this and I had no idea what this was. What questions would I have? 08:36 And you'll be able to fill in the gaps and make sure that people are, you know, people who are reading your requirements are actually able to understand and build off of them. 08:46 The next is delays. So if you don't have clear specs created, it's just going to slow down the whole process. 08:54 Another aspect is increased development cost and that really is due to the fact that if everything is not scoped out properly at the beginning of the build, It may end up taking much longer amount of time, or it may be implemented incorrectly. 09:10 And again, engineers cost companies a lot of money. So we want to make sure that we're actually building the right things, the right way, the first time. 09:19 Okay, so the next phase is actually the implementation phase. This is when the engineers actually code and create the new feature or update. 09:28 So an example here is that a developer may use Python, on Java, JavaScript, and different tools like GitHub to actually build out the feature. 09:39 And we're going to go into this in later lessons. But this is what you typically think of when you hear of an engineer coding. 09:46 This is when they're actually writing out the code, building the feature. So the important at this phase is that the feature that you're proposing and building is actually implemented according to these specs. 09:59 This ensures that, you know, what we eventually deliver to the user is actually what we wanted to deliver. It's solving the user problems. 10:09 And the engineers are a critical component of this step. And what's going to happen is while they're actually building, they're going to be asking you different questions here and there. 10:19 Things that they didn't think of during the design phase that have come up. So maybe they're implementing a feature around logging in with Google. 10:29 And one use case or edge case that they didn't anticipate was that Google may say this email address does not exist. 10:41 So we need to handle that in some way. So this may involve going back to our designer and saying, hey, we need to, the engineers came into an issue where signing in with Google results in the user not being able to be logged in because the email doesn't even exist at all. 11:00 So how should we handle that case? And then you'll go back and forth and work pretty quickly to try and solve that specific problem. 11:07 So you're really acting as a problem solver during this phase of implementation to make sure things move fast. every day you're going to have a stand-up typically and you're going to identify with the engineers any blockers that they're experiencing and you're going to work try to work really hard to 11:24 get rid of those blockers so that they can move fast and actually shift the future. So a couple of risks here. 11:31 So one poor implementation can lead to a product that is prone to errors. This could be user errors where it's difficult for a user to actually use. 11:40 On the flip side it could be kind of application errors. So again, in this case, if we're not handling all the different edge case or errors that can occur from an integration or from a feature, this could result in a really poor user experience. 11:56 Another problem that, and risk at this stage, is based on how it's actually coded and built, it may be difficult to maintain the future. 12:06 The engineer working on it may not write notes in the code about how things are working, or they may do a poor job. 12:13 So this is one of the risks at this stage. And finally, one of the risks during implementation is that the feature doesn't meet the requirement. 12:22 So it's important that while they're actually developing, you're kind of checking in frequently to make sure they understand how it works. 12:29 If you can get access to the feature or see a demo as they're building it, you can more quickly identify problems that you may want to solve. 12:39 Okay, so number four is the testing, the QA quality assurance phase. So at this stage, the main goal is that the product is thoroughly tested to identify and fix bugs. 12:52 You can come to expect that from pretty much every feature and thing that your team is going to be working on, there will be bugs when they first build it. 13:00 And it's going to be your job as well as if there's a QA person, as well as the engineers on your team to identify these bugs and actually fix them. 13:08 We want to also make sure that not only are the bugs identified and solved, but also that the features actually functioning properly. 13:18 So there may not be any bugs necessarily where it's broken, but the feature may not be based on the actual design or original idea for implementation. 13:29 So you want to identify this and work with the engineers to fix those bugs, fix the user experience issues so that the ultimate feature and product that is delivered to the user is basically what we designed in the beginning for it to look like. 13:46 So a couple examples here. The engineers are going to write unit tests, integration tests, system tests. These are basically different engineering terms for ways that within the code, they can create tests. 14:00 And that means, so for example, we'll go into it in a later lesson around APIs, but say we are expecting to get back a different information about weather. 14:13 So basically what the engineers will do is they will create a test file and it'll be kind of like a mock response. 14:22 So it'll have that test data stored in there and they'll make sure that when the feature is working, it's referencing that test data and spitting out and resulting in the proper end result. 14:37 So that means if the data says that the weather is cloudy and we want the user interface to say, hey Anthony, today the weather is cloudy. 14:47 What they would do is create a test to basically check that that's happening. And so during the kind of implementation phase, they're writing these tests and they're making sure that they're working so that we can really be confident that all the different cases about the feature are covered. 15:05 So again, the importance here is making sure that we identify and fix those bugs, verify the functionality, and make sure that the product actually meets the requirements. 15:15 Couple of risks at this stage. So one major risk is that if you don't test, there's a high likelihood that there's to be bugs that you don't know about, that ultimately are in the hands of the users and are causing user problems. 15:31 This isn't a lead to a poor user experience, maybe security vulnerabilities as well, and increased maintenance costs. And a big thing that happens at this stage is that if your team ships a feature with a bug in it and your team likely will do this many times, it's very common in the industry to ship 15:51 bugs. but we try to avoid it. What's gonna end up happening is your support team is probably gonna end up notifying you a day or two later that they're getting a lot of reports from users about different bugs in the product. 16:04 And then it's gonna be your job to, again, identify those bugs, reproduce them for your team, and work with them to quickly fix them so that they stop impacting users in a negative way. 16:16 Okay, so the fifth stage here is deployment. So this is when you actually release the feature out into the world, out to the end users. 16:24 There's two options here. You can do a phased rollout or a full release. So for a phased rollout, you may say, you know, we want to release this feature to only 10% of users to start. 16:35 So you release it to 10%, you see if there's any issues in production, you know, the real world environment. And then if it all looks good, you roll it out to more people. 16:47 So you may bump it up to 50% or 100% then. Other times, you may just do a full release and just go straight to 100% of users that are experiencing the feature and have access to the change. 17:00 So an example here, as I just mentioned, maybe you have a group of beta testers. So you have 50 people sign up to beta test the app and you can release the feature specifically to that group as opposed to just making it available to the entire public. 17:16 So, the importance here is that a successful deployment really ensures that the product reaches end users as planned without many different disruptions. 17:27 Doing a poor job at this stage can lead to downtime, downtime is where if you go to a website and nothing's loading, that's downtime. 17:37 That's where users can't really access the platform, dissatisfaction, and potentially a loss of customers or revenue. If your website is down, you know, people aren't going to wait around. 17:48 They're going to just exit out of it. Then may represent you lose that customer, you lose revenue. And that's never a good thing. 17:56 Okay, so now number six is the maintenance phase. So this is really the ongoing support and maintenance for the feature. 18:05 Over time, you're going to want to address bugs, add new features to it and update it as needed. So really, you need to keep in mind that when you're actually building these features, it's not like you just release the feature and then that's it. 18:20 Over time, you're going to need to maintain that. And what that means is bugs are going to occur and crop up with these features that you launch. 18:29 Basically, because you're continually evolving the product and it's so interconnected. So when you update one thing in one place, you're going to have to update it in another place and that other place may be the feature that you actually just launched. 18:44 So you're going to want to make sure that over time you're dedicating resources to maintaining the functionality so that the experience doesn't degrade and it doesn't become poor over time for users. 18:56 So a couple examples here, you could monitor user feedback to make sure that it's still functioning properly, you can prioritize and fix different bugs that are occurring with the feature and you So you can release updates to it over time to make it better and better. 19:11 The importance here is that it's really important to address these bugs because the more bugs that crop up, it kind of isn't compounding effect, the more likely that users are not going to like it and they're going to churn. 19:26 And too much churn can kill a company really. So you want to make sure you're keeping up with this and you're updating the feature as necessary. 19:34 A couple of risks here is that, you know, collecting this can really create a product that's outdated. You know, companies move fast, these software companies move really fast. 19:45 And the benefit of a small team and new competitor is that they can ship things really fast as opposed to bigger companies that are a little bit slower. 19:54 So it's important to make sure that you're constantly thinking about these things to make sure you're still competitive and make sure you're not losing users out to other companies, for example. 20:06 Okay, so that is kind of an overview of the software development. Life cycle, again, to go over this again, it's really a critical portion of the deployment and delivery of software in general. 20:22 Moving too fast or skipping over a stage can, as I mentioned, in each step, introduce a lot of risks and challenges that either are going to crop up really immediately or in a month or two down the line, which ultimately ends up in a poor product, low user satisfaction and overall, your success is going 20:44 to be limited. It's pretty important that you really make sure you're focusing on each one of these stages of the process to make sure that the ultimate software that you deliver is high-quality, reliable, and super competitive. 20:57 All right, I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to navigate each phase of the software development lifecycle so you can collaborate effectively with engineers to ship high-quality features from idea to launch.,89575b89-23fc-4144-8033-c288825c0cf7,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Software development life cycle (SDLC),6.1,TRUE,21,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:42.343605+00
0fff0b49a99445b3b48bd03b310919e5,"00:00 Hello and welcome to the first lesson in the DreamPM job application system module. In this overall module, I'm going to be going over several things. 00:11 Number one, how and where to find the right job opportunities for you to apply to. There's tons of job openings and we don't want to just apply to all of them and waste our time with that. 00:22 We want to apply to the ones that make the most sense for our use of time. Number two, we want to make sure that I, I share how to make yourself and your app application stand out to actually increase your chances of getting noticed and getting that first round interview. 00:38 Then I'll share how and when to actually apply, how to keep track of all your job applications and interviews, and then finally how to stay motivated and maintain in a positive. 00:48 Mindset during this, what could be a lengthy job search process. So let's just dive right into finding the right jobs to apply to. 00:57 So in this lesson, again, I'm going to go over how you can hand pick the best jobs that you should be applying for specifically in order to increase your. 01:05 Chances of getting an interview. You're going to need to put in a little bit of an extra work for each application. 01:10 And because of this, you'll need to be more selective around what jobs you actually end up applying for since each one is going to take a little bit more time. 01:18 So finding the right opportunities. Why does. Be sure to subscribe to our channel for more videos. Thanks for watching! Being selective matter. 01:22 Job hunting is like fishing. Casting a wide net may catch a lot of okay fish, but being selective with the right strategy would help you find the best fish. 01:33 Quality over quantity. So applying to every job can seem overwhelming and inefficient targeting the right jobs increases your chances of an interview and avoids burnout. 01:53 Apply to 700 jobs. They won't waste time on you if you don't appear qualified, and so it doesn't make sense to just apply to every single job because you probably aren't qualified or have the right background or experience for every single role out there. 02:26 So, having an interview just to have one won't really help aside from getting more practice. Every interview requires a lot of preparation, so it's better to focus on the leads and the companies that make the most sense. 02:39 You might be thinking, but the more I apply. The better the chances, right? Not necessarily. Quality over quantity is the name of the game. 02:47 And we're going to dive into why investing quality time in each application not only increases your chances, but also saves you from unnecessary frustration and disappointment. 02:57 Quantity is still important here, but it's just not the most important thing that you can be doing. So in this lesson, I'm going to be going over and going deep into the four vector fit. 03:07 Really striving towards being a specialized PM candidate. How can having four vector fit increase your chances? So this is just a quick overview. Companies are looking for a specific person to fill their PM role. They are not always looking for a generalist who can do it all. 03:24 And because of this, you want to figure out what types of roles you should be applying for. And so a good way to get specific here is what I call this four vector fit. 03:33 Number one the first vector technology, second business model, third role type, and finally fourth is the industry. Having all four vectors will increase your chances in an interview. 03:44 So just put together this quick. Chart that shows that as you have more of these vectors that match what a company has and is what this role has, the chances that you actually get an interview go up. 03:56 And here's a quick example to explain this concept. So which candidate would the recruiter pass through resume review if they just have to pass one? 04:04 The role is a growth product manager on the search or marketplace team at ZocDoc. If you're unfamiliar, ZocDoc is a marketplace to find doctors nearby. 04:15 So you can put in the types of specialty that you're looking for, the city, state, and then your insurance plan. 04:22 So, okay, we have two candidates here. Number one, candidate A is they have experienced doing sales for a native desktop B2B real estate platform. 04:32 Prior to that, real estate agent has real estate license. Okay, now candidate B. They're a marketing analyst at BetterHelp, which is a telehealth platform for mental health focused on increasing user acquisition. 04:45 Prior to that, intern at a hospital volunteers is an EMT on the side. Okay. I mean, from the rec- recruiter's perspective, candidate B is obviously so much more qualified and has so much more relevant experience than candidate A. 04:58 So as a recruiter, I would be, you know, immediately exiting out candidate A and going forward with candidate B if I had to choose one of these. 05:06 And so- this is why it makes sense to try to apply to roles where you have a lot of those vectors that are similar. 05:14 You know, the- the- for this candidate they have experienced increasing user acquisition, which is what the search and marketplace team would want. 05:32 So now I'm going to dive into each one. First, technology fit. Every company has a different tech stack that work with. 05:39 A tech stack is basically all the systems and tools that they use to run their platform. They may also look for candidates who have experienced with certain tools like amplitude. 06:11 Which is a data analytics or snowflake data warehousing and querying tool. Having technology fit can demonstrate that you have the skills and knowledge to be effective with the nuances between these different tools that the actual company that you're applying to uses. 06:27 Next, business model fit. Every company also has a different business model. In other words, how do they make money? What are their business fundamentals? 06:39 They may be looking for candidates with prior experience with the specific type of business model that they have. So, a couple examples of different business models here. 06:47 Content platforms that run on advertising revenue. So, an example of this is YouTube or HBO. Even though they have subscription, they'll also run ads. 06:56 Hulu also runs ads. These are content platforms that run on advertising revenue. So, maybe you have experience within this realm. 07:04 Second, secondarily, a three-way marketplace. So, Uber is a good example here. So, Uber Eats, you have the restaurants, you have the couriers, and then you have the customers. 07:14 So, there's three different groups of people that are trying to use this platform. You have to build features and functionality for all three of them. 07:23 You have to make sure the dynamics of this marketplace are working efficiently and all together. You know, you need restaurants to be able to provide the food. 07:32 You need customers to actually buy the food and request the food and all these three things need to work together. 07:40 Two-way marketplace is another. Subscription-based B2B businesses or e-commerce, etc. There's a bunch of different business models. Each one has its own nuances. 07:50 Within a three-way marketplace there's so much happening and there's a lot that people get to get experience with. So if you've worked in a company with a three-way marketplace, look for other companies with that business model. 08:04 Because you're going to have a leg up in the interview process. You'll be viewed much more attractively as someone who has experience with a different business model, for example. 08:15 If you only have experience with e-commerce, a content platform that runs on advertising revenue is a whole other ballgame. It's going to be more difficult for you to stand out for those types of roles. 08:28 The next role fit. So there's so many types of PM roles out there and choosing one that best fits your background will help you have a leg up. 08:36 Technical PMs. Do you have tech experience, a background in computer science or data science, data analytics, anything more technical you may lean for more of a tech technical product manager role. 08:49 Platform PMs. Do you have experience working on systems? That support internal teams? Mobile PMs. Do you have experience working on an iOS or Android app in a previous role or on the site as a side project? 09:02 Web PMs. Do you have experience working with a website product? Internal tool PMs. Do you have experience using internal tool? 09:11 Growth PMs. Do you have marketing experience or experience with data and running tests? Different different, you know, aspects of your background may make you more of an attractive candidate. 09:25 Companies are looking for PMs who have experience and skills that align with that role. So a platform PM will deal with vastly different problems than a growth PM so it may be difficult to transition. 09:38 And so really think about your specific background. You know, do you have a background in sales and marketing, maybe growth is going to be best for you. 09:46 Or do you have a background in customer support and you've used a ton of internal tools and you know what works and what doesn't work. 09:55 You're going to be a great PM probably for the internet. And once you become an internal tools product manager, eventually you can transition to another team. 10:04 Once you learn the PM skill set on the job, but this is the types of things that you should be thinking through as it relates to the jobs that you end up applying for industry fit. 10:13 This is arguably one of the most important and powerful vectors. Companies are looking for candidates who have prior experience in their specific industry. 10:22 They may prefer those who already have knowledge of their field. Having experience in the same industry as a company can make it easy. 10:29 Easier for you to understand the business, customer needs, and competitive landscape. So, to dive into some examples, health tech, technology for healthcare, like telemedicine or wearable devices. 10:41 The whole world of health tech is huge, there's so much to it, whether it's health insurance or HIPAA considerations or EHR software, whatever it may be, there's so much within the world of health tech that you're going to be more attractive as a candidate if you have some prior experience there. 10:59 FinTech, I've tried to apply to, FinTech roles and I've had the recruiter literally say, do you have any past experience within FinTech? 11:07 We're really looking for a FinTech person and I didn't and I didn't get farther in the interview process and so think about the app. 11:18 Aspects of your background where you've done work in the past, where you've researched, where you've done side projects whether it's, you know, in the world of the legal world with lawyers or agriculture or HR or marketing. 11:34 Whatever it might be, the industry is going to be pretty important for you and it's going to help you stand out against other candidates. 11:43 So ultimately, you want to find your four vector fit and jobs that fit those four vectors. Now that you know all of them, try to figure out what four vectors you closely align to. 11:55 This is going to help, like help you out when you want to map to the jobs that you end up applying to. 11:59 So as an example, for technology, I previously worked at a company that had an iOS app, business model. I previously worked at a company that managed a marketplace role. 12:10 My team was in charge of increasing app revenue. And then the industry fit was live events. Then you want to find jobs that match some of some or all those vectors. 12:19 So a couple of examples, StubHub, mobile growth PM. Eventbrite, mobile PM, Airbnb, mobile PM because that has the business model, the technology, and the role fit as well. 12:31 The industry is a little bit different, but at least I have all three of those vectors. So think about what are your vectors and within tech. 12:38 There's a lot that you probably have experience with. So write it all down business model. You may have worked at several companies with different business models. 12:46 So write those all down and then you'll come up with your set of four vectors, which is going to help you to narrow down what jobs you eventually apply to. 12:54 In terms of order operations at any given time, there may be hundreds or thousands of these open roles. And so you need a game plan of which ones you should try to apply to first. 13:05 So start in the order of roles where you have high four vector fit and then go down to low four vector fit. 13:12 So immediately the first jobs when you're ready to start applying should be the ones where you have all four vectors. 13:19 And then over time as you run through all those, start getting less and less specific. But this way it gives you your best chance of getting inner views right at the end. 13:50 Help you to stand out. Technology and then finally role fit. Role fit is, role type is least important because you know, a lot of the time when you're transitioning, you, you won't have necessarily prior experience with, within like a platform product manager role or a growth product manager role 14:10 . But it's still generally important if you have background that relates. So one of the role types. So no, they're all important, but this ordering hopefully will help as a mental model for when and where you want to optimize. 14:23 So where are you going to look for these opportunities? So there's a ton of job sites out there that can help you search for open roles, but these are the ones that I typically always go back to. 14:34 So LinkedIn is huge. LinkedIn is going to be one of your best sources for product manager roles. And I'll, I'll soon go into how you can set up alerts there. 14:43 Built in NYC is also a great marketplace. And job listing board, it's really centered around jobs and you can put in whatever you want. 14:53 Years of experience less than one and see jobs. And you know, there's going to be tons of results. Obviously there's not a lot of results for this one, but let's apply. 15:02 Let's do different job categories. Let's see finance. Okay. So okay. So I fixed the categories here. Type product manager. Remote hybrid and look at all the results. 15:23 So chapter, growth, product manager, Capital One, SOFI. You know, these are great. This is a great resource for different types of PM roles and they have different years of experience. 15:35 But find ones that make sense. You know, there's so many different types of jobs and companies out there. You never know what's out there. 15:44 As you see, 11 plus pages. You want to narrow this list down based on your fit. Lenny's job board. So Lenny, is a creator. 15:54 He used to be a product manager, I believe at Airbnb, and he has a podcast and a newsletter. And you know, he will have sometimes have these product manager roles on his job board. 16:09 Google search, product manager job openings, indeed Glassdoor are a couple as well. But LinkedIn is going to be probably the best bet for you. 16:18 Because ultimately LinkedIn is, is probably one of the biggest networks for recruiters. And it's really easy for them to do everything out of there. 16:27 So I'm going to dive into doing this on LinkedIn. So setting alerts is one of the most important things you can do during your job search because you want to be the first person to know when a role opens up on one of these platforms. 16:41 So what you can do is you can manage this within the alert section. You can type product manager into your the search bar, search, and then depending on the filters, like you could put the location as New York or do remote. 16:55 I'm setting alert. You can manage the alerts there and anytime, you know, this one is daily via email. So every time there's a new product manager listing on a daily basis, LinkedIn is going to send you an email directly letting you know to apply. 17:10 So you can update the alert frequency to be daily. You can get notified email and notification or just email. I would say get notified for similar jobs. 17:20 Mark that as yes so that you can expand the search a little bit and You can also customize your alert. 17:27 So when you're doing research you may find a company that you perfectly fit that perfectly fits your background, but they don't necessarily have open PM roles right now. 17:36 So instead of just moving on, set up an alert for that company and the keyword product manager. So you'll, you'll type into the search bar you know, product manager, you'll filter down to the company, show the results, and then you will right over here, set up a job alert for that. 17:53 So the next time, you know, cadre or ripple or whoever gated dog opens up a PM role, you are going to get an email like that day. 18:02 And this is going to give you a massive advantage. Additionally, filter for jobs that were recently posted. Companies that are in high demand will typically keep their job open for a short period of time, sometimes just a couple days and then close it because they get hundreds of candidates 18:19 that have applied. And the reason they do this is because there There are qualified people who, actually applied so filter down to past week past 24 hours to really see like what is the latest the jobs that were posted. 18:41 So I had the best chance. Additionally, hide roles that you're not going to apply to. So within the LinkedIn view, you can actually hover over this button on the right to hide a job. 18:54 So if you see senior product manager core experience and your entry level, you're like, I'm definitely not going to get this job. 19:01 It's a senior PM role. I just want to apply to associate and P N product. Manager level roles, hide that job so you don't have to waste your time seeing that again, because a lot of the time these jobs will just repop up in the search results field. 19:15 So that's gonna make it a lot easier for you to parse through over time. Next search directly on a company's career page. 19:23 So companies won't always post their job listings on the like aggregator sites like LinkedIn or Indeed and instead they just leave them on the careers or job page within their website. 19:35 One reason that they may do this is they want candidates who are so passionate about their company specifically and not just anyone on the internet looking for a job. 19:43 So make sure to check out all these sites. You know, when you're evaluating companies, whether you find it on built-in NYC or somewhere else, make sure to actually check their jobs page. 19:54 Next, apply to the right level. Another factor is that you need to take into consideration is the level of the position. 20:02 A rule of thumb is that if you're a first-time PM and you're entering their career, you're going to want to do so with either an associate product manager role or a product manager role. 20:13 Senior PM roles almost always require previous experience as a PM and so it's not worth applying and wasting your time with these roles if you're just starting out. 20:22 I wouldn't always worry about the required years of experience for roles. Logically makes sense to not spend time applying something that, you know, requires four to five years of product experience. 20:32 But if it says one to two, it's probably worth putting your hat in the ring. You know, the worst that can happen is that you just get rejected. 20:41 A quick overview of levels. So an associate product manager is someone who typically has zero to two years of product experience. 20:48 They may spend one to two years in this role. A product manager has two to five years of product experience and they'll spend two to three years here seeing your PM five to eight. 20:58 Again, spend, you know, a couple to four years here. And then it goes up from there. So we have lead PM, group PM or staff PM. 21:06 This is, you know, one of the highest level product managers that is, that is an individual contributor. Group PM starts to manage other product managers, whereas lead PM or staff PM, these are probably individual contributors just operating at a very high level. 21:21 We have directors of products, senior directors of products, VP of products, senior VP and chief product officer. You know, it's pretty rare for actually you someone to have 30 plus years in product management since it's a relatively new career track. 21:37 But there are some people, you know, who have been doing this a very long time and these are, these are just like a general amount of years of experience. 21:46 You're going to definitely see out in the wild chief product officers that are 35 years old. You know, they may have had 10 years in product and they had a particular path to get there. 21:56 So but this generally hopefully will help you understand. The next thing to note is that levels really by a company. 22:04 So do your research. The level product manager might be the title at a company for someone that they're, they're requiring 8 to 12 years experience experience for. 22:18 The reason that they do this is they don't want the title of people on their team to create an environment where everyone is not on an equal playing field. 22:27 And instead they want to make sure the team focuses on being collaborative and flexible rather than having a rigid ring. 22:35 So instead of a company having like an associate product manager, product manager, senior product manager, staff product manager, everyone will just be product manager. 22:45 And you know, internally in the background, there's going to be different levels and you'll have different pay for those levels. 22:50 And so this you know, a company may be hiring for a product manager with eight to 12 years experience. That ultimately they're doing this to create a more level playing field within the company. 23:03 Additionally, some companies may have different levels, product manager, senior product manager, years required to get these roles may vary. So some places may think someone with two years experience can be a senior PM. 23:14 Other places may think you know, the person should have six years experience to be a senior product manager. So it's definitely very variable. 23:22 So research the company in the next lesson I'm going to go over standing out in the application process after Thank you. 23:40 You've ultimately decided which roles and companies you're going to apply to. Alright, see you there.",Learn how to prioritize product manager job applications using four-vector fit and targeted search tactics so you can focus on roles most likely to yield interviews.,b0baf2c2-f113-43ff-b9ea-3fb1514585f9,228e379f-ab90-4fa0-aca1-1c49844bc738,Finding the right jobs to apply to,1,TRUE,24,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:51.61349+00
37642fc608724b8ab1b58b9f9822c082,"0:00 In this lesson, we're going to go over standing out in the application process. So number one thing to do here is to customize your resume to the job description. 0:09 So again, as we went over in the previous resume lessons, you're going to want to start out out with that baseline resume. 0:15 This is the resume. So this is the resume that you've sent to me. I've reviewed it. We've worked on it together to make sure that it's really tough notch. 0:22 You're going to duplicate that resume file and you're going to name it Anthony Saltarelli, you know, your name company resume. 0:29 So this is going to be specific to that company that you're applying to. Thank you. And when applying to jobs, instead of just using your baseline resume, you should tailor it to the specific job. 0:39 So take a look at the job description and actually see what they are looking for. And then you're going to update your bullets to take into account language that they're using. 0:47 Also, you want to change the order of bullet points based on recruiter or hiring manager. Ask yourself if I was the recruiter for this role, would I pass this resume through to the hiring manager? 1:09 Does it meet what they're looking for based on the job description? Customizing is going to help you stand out in this process and, you know, hopefully the recruiter or hiring manager is going to think, wow, this can't be perfect. 1:22 Now, this is one of the things that I mentioned before that's going to take extra time and why you want to not just apply to every single job you see, because this will take time. 1:34 And it's going to be, if you're doing this for hundreds of job applications, it's not going to work out. So you want to be mindful of the jobs that you're deciding to apply to. 1:44 And this is all tied into who you're networking with and all of that. So an example of customizing your foundational baseline bullet. 1:53 You may have a bullet that says analyzed data to identify user behavior trends and leveraged findings to guide the development of a new product features leading to a 15% increase in user engagement and enhancing overall customer satisfaction. 2:06 You may be applying to this PM role for Atomic. And okay, let's just read through the description. Research, build, and launch new features from inception to mass adoption. 2:16 Monitor and analyze product metrics to uncover unique insights. Okay, who you are. You love Web3 and crypto and have experienced building in the space. 2:24 You have experienced with Excel, Google Sheets, and SQL. So let's see, how can we incorporate all of this into our resume? 2:33 So with Web3 and crypto you might put this in your, your summary statement up at the top. For this bullet, you might update it to say Analyze the data with SQL and Google Sheets to identify and, and make sure to only do this if it's true, don't lie. 2:49 But analyze data with SQL and Google Sheets to identify user behavior trends, leveraged insights to guide development of new product features, leading to a 15%. 2:57 Increase in engagement and feature adoption. So this is basically saying the thing, but it's being a little bit more specific based on the keywords that you've seen here. 3:08 So now when a recruiter is looking at this, the recruiter is comparing your resume don't want to change them if it will result in it not being accurate. 3:34 The next thing that you can do to stand out is to complete and share case studies. So make sure you're running through the Product Portfolio Pro modules and trainings to learn how to create these case studies and present them on your portfolio. 3:47 Once you create one, you should share it out with your network. You never know who's going to check it out and it can always result in more opportunities coming your way. 3:55 So an example post after you create a custom case study. It could be, you know, recently the education edtech industry has piqued my interest. 4:05 Specifically, I think it's really interesting how we can use AI to improve the learning experience for children with learning disabilities. 4:14 I ended up exploring this in much more detail and put together a case study for how to do XYZ. Check it out in my portfolio here. 4:22 This is going to be an awesome way to get your case study out there, get people learning that you're really good at identifying these problems, generating a hypothesis, and thinking through how we can solve this core problem. Again, it's estimated that 85% of job offers are given to employee referrals 4:58 , so make sure to watch all the lessons within the foolproof PM networking system trainings to learn the most effective ways to actually know. 5:08 Next is to join communities and attend events. So there's several product manager communities that you can join, and you're going to meet people in the industry and learn about open roles. 5:18 So one example of this is product manager jobs another is product manager jobs. Community. This is hosted by product school. 5:27 And also look on meetup or other community platforms for local events that you could attend within your area. So these could be startup meetups, tech meetups in general, engineering product meetups. 5:38 You could attend conference. And there could be a lot of uh, different kinds of, um, things that you could come through with these, then add it to the skills section on your resume. 5:58 So a couple examples here. SQL, understanding how to query databases will enable you to pull data and analyze user behavior, which is a key part of the product management career. 6:09 Data analytics tools. So learning to use tools like amplitude or Google analytics or mixpanel will help you to analyze user interactions and make those data driven decisions. 6:20 Project management, Jira, Trello, Asana, wireframing and prototype. Figma is an example of the most popular one, so you learn these skills online and then ultimately put them on your resume. 6:31 You can share it on your LinkedIn profile. This is going to help you stand out. So hopefully this helped you understand different ways that you can stand out in the application process. 6:41 In the next lesson, I'll be going over how to actually apply to these jobs.","Learn how to tailor your resume and showcase case studies, networking, and relevant skills so you can stand out and improve your chances of landing interviews.",18269e65-a4f7-42c8-a646-73533c05b037,228e379f-ab90-4fa0-aca1-1c49844bc738,Standing out in the application process,2,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:52.091527+00
d23e78ded063423eb35536b284b3f13b,"0:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over how to apply. So the first thing here, when and where to apply. 0:06 As mentioned in previous lessons and throughout the program, getting a referral is going to significantly increase your chances at actually landing an interview. 0:15 you. If you haven't written, um, all these papers on the left over here are applications to just one open PM role at a company. 0:22 How do you actually get to the top of this list? There's really two ways. One is getting a referral that's going to bump you up and help you stand out. 0:31 Or secondarily, if you can't get a referral, you can't get a referral. You want to apply fast and early. 0:35 Applicants at the bottom of this list may not even get their resumes reviewed. These candidates before them got interviews and were good enough to get hired for that role. 0:44 So, what does the timeline look like? You know, this is going to be tricky to navigate. Day zero is when a new product manager job description is published online for company ABC. 0:54 Day one, say you have successfully set up the LinkedIn alert or you're just checking on a day to day basis. 1:00 You're going to get alerted to that new PM job opening and you can quickly start networking with five to 15 people of that company using what you learned in the foolproof product manager networking system, as well as the product portfolio pro, um, how to stand out networking, uh, networking lesson. 1:17 Um, so then within days two to four, you're going to wait for people to respond to you. And if they do respond, you'll set up calls with them. 1:25 You could also, um, within this time, uh, follow up with them. But then on day four and later, if you have calls at this point set up, don't apply yet. 1:35 You will ask the contacts. That you're networking with for a referral after speaking with them. But if no one has responded, you should just go ahead and directly apply because the chances that someone's in a respond are pretty low at this point. 1:48 Um, so hopefully that helps you understand like the general timeline. Um, overall. Here you're, you're gearing towards getting that referral and getting these networking calls set up with people at the company. 1:59 Um, but if that doesn't happen, um, you should just go ahead and apply directly, um, because you still want to get your application in. 2:06 So there's two ways to apply through. Referral or just a regular application. If you are going to get a referral, um, it's, it's worth resetting this specific job posting to your contact to make sure they refer you to the right role. 2:21 Like if there's only one job opening or if it's clear the job, uh, you should be referred to. You don't need to include it in the email, but typically like a company will be apply, uh, will be hiring for a couple product manager roles at the same time. 2:34 And so you just want to make sure that the person you're networking with knows exactly which one they should refer you to. 2:41 Um, secondarily, you'll want to attach your resume as a PDF to the email you send your contact and make sure there are no typos, name it, you know, name company resume, like Anthony Saltarelli Figma Resume. 2:54 Um, the other way to do this is through, uh, through a regular. Job application, so do the same, um, with your PDF, but instead just upload it to the job application. 3:04 If there are other fields on the, uh, form, make sure to include your LinkedIn profile and your portfolio links right on the job application. 3:16 This way, the recruiter or the hiring manager or whoever is looking at your candidacy can quickly link out and view those. 3:26 Cover letters are typically not worth including, although you can always watch one if you want to, and I would recommend reviewing the Harvard cover letter guide for tips and tricks within that. 3:38 In the next lesson, I'll go over how to keep track of all of your job applications and interviews. See you there.",Learn how to time your PM job applications by prioritizing referrals and applying early so you can increase your chances of getting your resume reviewed.,260a7df9-4bc8-4f27-ad56-c4e6c76ec5f3,228e379f-ab90-4fa0-aca1-1c49844bc738,How to Apply,3,TRUE,4,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:52.659829+00
080c8051412548dda28152d56c47ce36,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm gonna go over how to stay motivated during the job application process, which may take weeks or months for you to actually land a role. 0:09 So, you will land a role that is meant to be. Applying and interviewing is mentally draining. There's no, there's no way around that. 0:16 It is definitely draining. Um, just try to keep in mind and remind yourself that you will eventually land your dream role. 0:24 It may take some time. You may have to go down a certain path that you didn't originally plan for, but you'll ultimately make it if it's what's meant to be for you. 0:32 You should view each rejection as redirection. In other words, every time that you're rejected from one specific role, view it as being redirected towards something that will be an even better fit for you. 0:45 Um, ultimately, you know, different product manager roles. There's everything is different and the reason that you're rejected may mean that it wasn't going to be a good fit given your background. 0:57 It would have been really challenging for you. Um, and so take this as redirection like, you know, I should put my efforts elsewhere. 1:05 So imagine you have, you're, you're applying, you're doing all this work. Application one, two, three, you're editing your resume, you're networking, and you're not getting any interviews. 1:14 After application nine, you may be thinking to yourself, I want to give up. Um, and, and a lot of people will at, certain points give up, but little did they know application number 10 was going to lead to their first interview. 1:27 And so just keep this in mind as you go through the process. These rejections are hard and you'll get, you'll get a lot. 1:34 I've gotten a lot. Everyone I know gets rejected. You know, no one is getting 100% of the interviews that are, you know, interviews for the jobs that are applying for. 1:44 Um, so it's, it's part of the process. It is a numbers game as I, as I mentioned, but make sure to stay motivated because you never know. 1:51 The next one is if. It's going to be the one where you get an interview. Next, make an active effort to be kind to yourself. 2:00 Um, as I mentioned, this is a long journey. When you're going through the process of trying to become a PM, be kind to yourself. 2:06 Um, if you hit road bumps here or there, just know that you're on the right path, other people are going through a Every PM has gotten a ton of rejections before. 2:30 They just ended up pushing through, improving, and getting better over time. So just keep this in mind. There are hundreds, thousands of product managers out there, and they all worked really hard to get there. 2:41 They're, they all were rejected from several, if not dozens of other roles, but they ultimately made it and they're, they're, you know, enjoying their careers at the beginning of your journey, make a list of things that you'd like to do decompress, relax, like going on walks and getting outdoors. 2:55 You can do a spa day, getting in deser- or when you hit road bumps along your journey, don't hesitate to indulge yourself in one of these self-care activities. 3:05 Your mental health is really important to focus on throughout this process, uh, because, you know, if you're, if you're getting extremely stressed and discouraged, it's gonna be tough for you to keep on going. 3:15 So be kind to yourself with the rejections. Keep on reminding yourself that this happens to everyone. You just need to persevere and continue to push through. 3:24 Next, when you get rejected, because you will get rejected to some of these jobs, don't overthink it. It's an easy and normal reaction to severely overthink being rejected after interviewing for a PM role, like I'm not good enough, or I don't have the skills, or I shouldn't be wasting my time trying 3:41 to become a PM, or I'll never make it as a PM. Instead of having these self-referrable, limiting beliefs and reactions after being rejected, look into ways you can improve yourself and move on to the next role. 3:53 As you're doing this, don't beat yourself up about it, just view it as a learning experience. This is kind of like dating as well. 3:59 If you get rejected on a date, like, think back, like, you know, what? What happened here? Why didn't it go well? 4:05 Where didn't we click? Maybe we weren't meant to be together or maybe, you know, I said this and I shouldn't have, have some introspection, but don't overthink it too much. 4:15 It's very likely that you were rejected for a small reason or they did. Like you, but ended up going with another candidate. 4:21 And so because of this possibility, you shouldn't beat yourself up about it. If you got passed up on for a role. 4:27 Um, a lot of the time there are several qualified candidates. Um, so you just need to keep on continuing to persevere and continue applying. 4:34 Um, so hopefully these tips help you, um, to stay motivated during this application process. I know it can be tough and a struggle, but, um, keep in mind, every product manager out there has gone through this. 4:46 No one immediately got a job. They all had to go through rejections. Everyone makes mistakes, um, and, and keep this in mind, uh, to, to be kind to yourself throughout the process. 4:58 Alright, I'll see you in the next one.","Learn how to stay motivated during a long job search by reframing rejection, practicing self-care, and avoiding overthinking so you can keep applying until you land a role.",60a7b7b5-1009-497e-8032-ad8bb252c933,228e379f-ab90-4fa0-aca1-1c49844bc738,Staying motivated during your search,4,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:53.136327+00
64968478e5204836ab68d77dd4e53f2e,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over how you should pause and brainstorm in a PM interview. Now, the reason I'm making this video lesson is that it doesn't always come easy and natural for people to pause and brainstorm and just, like, have quiet time in an interview because they're so conditioned to 0:17 always talk and, and fill in the space and be providing an answer. So, we're going to go over how to do this effectively. 0:24 When you should do it, how long you should pause, all those, uh, details. So, what are pauses? So, in a case study style interview, you're going to be thinking through a problem or a situation live. 0:35 You're not going to know it ahead of time. They're just going to give you some type of prompt and you're going to have to think through it. 0:41 And it's very rare for someone to be able to immediately jump into explaining or solving a problem with a coherent approach. 0:48 So, that's why pausing to think and brainstorm in that moment is recommended in PM interviews. 0:59 PM interviewers are very used to people pausing to brainstorm, so you do not need to feel awkward for doing this. 1:06 In fact, it is expected that you would actually spend some time to collect your thoughts in the same way that if you're going to be a task at work or some type of problem to solve, you're going to first probably spend some time, like, thinking about it, researching it, doing that pre-work before diving 1:22 into actually working with your team to solve it. So, why is pausing so powerful and effective? Number one, there are the psychological and strategic benefits of pausing. 1:33 It allows time for you to collect your thoughts and organize them. And it prevents knee-jerk reactions and increases confidence, uhm, in the answer that you're delivering. 1:44 Next, it enhances clarity in your communication. So, it helps you to reduce filler words and rambling because you already know what you're trying to talk about. 1:53 And it makes the responses just more structured, more impactful, easier to follow along for the interviewer. When and how should you should you be taking these pauses? 2:02 So, there are a few scenarios where it makes sense to pause and spend some time before thinking. So, or sorry, spend some time thinking before you actually go and respond. 2:11 Number one is in a behavioral interview. So, if you're asked a question and that you've never been asked for or that completely stumps with you where you have no idea what you're going to say or talk about, you could say something like, that is a really interesting question. 2:24 Let me think about it, uh, or let me think about a good example here. And then just pause for 10, 15 seconds to think about what you want to talk about the example that you want to share. 2:36 Then is the next scenario are case studies. So, when you're in a product sense or analytics or strategy interview, you're encouraged to pause and brainstorm before explaining your thought process. 2:48 Say something like, alright, great. So, I'm gonna first start by exploring a couple different user types that might be impacted here. 2:56 If it's alright with you, I'm just gonna jot down some notes for a couple seconds here and then I'll share what I'm thinking. 3:01 Then you pause brainstorm before moving on to presenting. So, how long should these pauses be? Cover this a little bit, but pausing for too long could be suspect to the interviewer and, Signal to them that you aren't prepared or you can't think on your feet depending on the interview question. 3:19 So, to give you some guidance, um, if it's a behavioral interview, you'll want to try to pause for about 10 to 20 seconds, 10, 15, 20 seconds to think of a good example and then share it if you're really stumped. 3:30 In case interviews, you could pause for up to one to two minutes depending on where you are in the interview, but this is, generally a good, a good time frame. 3:39 If you go over these amounts, the interviewer is going to start to question why you're taking so long. So, you want to keep these guidelines in mind. 3:47 Um, the important piece of information here, though, is that pauses are encouraged, just not for too long. The other thing I'll note is that, um, another thing that could be very suspect is if you're using your computer and you're paused, but it's, It might be clear that you're actually searching something 4:03 on Google or searching something on chat TBT and doing that live. You absolutely want to avoid doing this because if the interviewer gets any inclination that you're trying to cheat, uh, in this interview in any way, they're going to immediately raise red flags and not move you forward. 4:21 They do not want to hire someone who can just type into chat TBT. They're going to want to, hire someone who is able to take a problem and answer it in an intelligent and structured way themselves. 4:32 So, I wanted to go over some tricks for, um, some natural pauses that you could deploy. So, one thing that you could do is you could repeat and paraphrase a question. 4:41 Um, this is an effective way to just gain some extra thinking time before you dive into your response because, um, it Well, uh, the interview will have to respond to you and that gives you a couple of extra seconds. 4:55 The last piece is, as you're saying it, you can start thinking in your head about what you want to say in the answer. 5:01 So, um, the interviewer might say, how would you improve the onboarding experience for a new user? So, you could say, that is a great question. 5:09 So, just to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly, you're asking how We can enhance a user's first interaction with the product to drive engagement and retention. 5:19 Is that right? And just going through that gives you a couple extra seconds because they're gonna then respond for you to start thinking and have the wheels in your head start turning, um, for you to think about what you want to say. 5:31 The next thing you could do to get even more time is ask a clarifying question and you're encouraged to do this anyways, but If a question is broad or ambiguous, you could ask a clarifying question to narrow the scope. 5:42 Um, and this can provide you with that additional time to give you more, uh, more time to process. So the interviewer might say, how do you improve engagement for our mobile app? 5:51 You could say, well, that's a really interesting challenge. Are you looking for improvements specifically around retention or are you more focused on increasing daily active users? 6:01 These are, Or something else, then they're going to talk for a little bit. Um, they're going to give more information, at least 10 or 15 seconds for them to respond, and you're going to be able to spend that time, um, thinking about where you want to head with this, with this, uh, interview question. 6:17 The last trick here I have is to sip water. So this is a very natural way to pause without awkwardness, um, because everyone- and drink water. 6:26 So it gives your brain a brief moment to just recalibrate. Um, and what you'll want to do to prepare for this is to remember to always have a bottle or a class of water right by your side during the interview so that you can leverage it in this way. 6:40 Um, so hopefully this helped to give you a, a little bit more guidance on how to effectively pause in PM interviews. 6:47 Again, what you need to know is that pausing is- very encouraged. Use this time effectively to structure your answers. Just don't go overboard and pause for three, four, five minutes. 6:58 That would be way too inappropriate, um, and would raise some red flags with the interviewers. So hopefully that helped and I'll see you in the next video.","Learn how to pause and brainstorm effectively in PM interviews so you can deliver structured answers without awkwardness, rambling, or raising red flags.",783e7221-8516-48be-ba80-75cc5c213342,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,How to Pause & Brainstorm,10,TRUE,8,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:09.45342+00
879928c1612844738eea4a77c2aeb68f,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over how to ask effective clarifying questions. In a lot of the other videos, I've shared that you need to ask clarifying questions, but in this video, I want to dive deep into what are these clarifying questions, why should you really ask them, and how can you ask them 00:16 , what types of questions can you ask. And then at the end, I'll go through three different examples of interview prompts, and then a bunch of clarifying questions. 00:24 questions that you could ask in those scenarios, just to spark some ideas and get you acquainted with the types of clarifying questions that you could be asking. 00:33 So, what are clarifying questions at the highest level? In a case study style interview, like the product sense or the execution interview, you're tasked with solving some type of problem prompt or task. 00:46 The prompts are oftentimes very vague and open-ended. I've gotten asked questions that are as broad as improve Netflix. So, um, there are probably hundreds or even thousands of ways to improve Netflix. 00:58 And so the thought is, where would you even begin? Like, are we talking about content, the settings page, discovery? Like, there's so many different areas to explore. 01:07 So, that's why clarifying questions are important and where they come into play. These are questions that you're encouraged to ask the interviewer, um, so that you can narrow down the scope of the exercise so that you're giving an answer for what they actually expect. 01:22 And it also is helpful to just set yourself up for success. You don't want to just dive into an answer because you're probably gonna go in the wrong direction because the prompt might be too big or too vague for you actually to go off So, there are actually a lot of intentionally asking vague questions 01:39 to see if you're gonna ask clarifying questions. So, to dive into that a little bit more, the why behind why this is important, it, it helps ensure that you have a clear understanding of the problem before you dive into your answer. 01:51 You don't want to just jump in immediately, start answering a question because you don't know anything about the question yet. 01:58 Like, you've just been asked it. You don't know What? The deeper level of why it's being asked or really what the goals are of the question. 02:05 Next, it shows you're a structured thinker and that you, you break things down. You're analytical in that sense. You don't just, again, jump into an answer. 02:12 You're trying to break down different pieces of it in your head, um, and, and get answers there so that when you do come to answering, you're, you're approaching it in an effective manner. 02:22 It also prevents incorrect assumptions on your answer. And that could lead to an off track response. So you might be asked a question like improve Netflix and you might think immediately, okay, like they're talking about the user experience, but they might actually be wanting you to focus on the technical 02:38 performance of Netflix. You have no idea really. What is that? Um, what are all the assumptions on their end and, and, and what are they assuming So you want to go through those questions. 02:48 What those assumptions? Think about, okay, I, I, I assume that we have to focus on this and, and check in with the interviewer to make sure you're aligned. 02:56 Um, not to skip ahead. So the next is, uh, asking clarifying questions demonstrates confidence, passion, and curiosity in the conversation. 03:06 When you ask these clarifying questions, you're showing like you are confidently answering this question. You have a handle on it. 03:12 You, you know it. You know what you want to know. You're asking these questions, getting more info, and you're really able to lead the discussion. 03:18 Next, you're passionate about this. You're excited to ask those clarifying questions. You want to learn more, and that leads to curiosity, which is a great skill for product managers to have because the world is, you know, uhm, just out there, and product managers are trying to learn from it to build 03:35 great user experiences. You, you want to be curious. You want to learn more. Asking clarifying questions demonstrates that skill to an interviewer that you can learn more by asking the right questions. 03:47 Uhm, it also is very relevant to the real world. So, when you're working with different stakeholders, they're often providing you with these, like, vague problem or broad problem statements. 03:56 They might say, well, this thing is broken, or whatever. Like, you need to dig in. With a bunch of questions to really learn, like, what actually is the problem? 04:05 What are they really talking about? In the same way, in a user interview where a user says, oh, well, I don't really like this screen. 04:11 It's like, well, what don't you like about it? We need to dig in to get to the deeper level to really understand that viewpoint of the user, so that we don't make the wrong assumptions and don't solve the wrong problems. 04:23 The last piece of why this is so important is because there are literally sections in the grading rubric for asking clarifying questions and the quality of those questions. 04:34 So, asking the right questions, the quality, and using those answers is actually important because it impacts your score. So, for all these reasons, it's important, but also, they're, you know, one of the vectors that they're evaluating you on. 04:49 Is if you were able to ask intelligent, relevant, quality, clarifying questions that then drive the rest of your answer. So, how do you ask effective questions? 05:03 There's a couple different ways that you can go about doing this. So, number one, you can rephrase the question to ensure that you're interpreting it correctly. 05:10 So you could say, when you say improving engagement, I've never Netflix. Like, do you mean increasing daily active users? Do you mean reducing churn? 05:17 Or do you mean something else? Um, you then want to identify key ambiguity. So, what information is missing from the prompt? 05:25 They might give you this vague, high-level prompt. So, what are all the pieces that are missing? So, um, you know, you could say, are we assuming that this is about an existing product or should we consider a new solution altogether? 05:37 Then, you want to break down the problem. So, um, there's, these are a couple different ways you can break it down by the time frame of the solution. 05:45 So, are we talking about, um, deploying a solution in the next two weeks or are we talking about two months or two years? 05:51 Um, what is the scale? Like, how big are we talking? Are we talking about at the level of introducing a mobile app or at the level of a feature within the mobile app? 06:00 Um, the next target users segments or product areas, um, or business and strategic goals. These are just more ways that you can think about breaking down the problem. 06:10 Um, and this ties into the framework, uh, that you'll go through as well. But when it comes to the clarifying questions, you want to just at the, the start of these interviews, get that information from the interviewer so that you can take it and run with it, uh, when answering the problem. 06:25 Another way to do this, or a way to think about this is, and it's really easy to remember, it's just who, what, when, where, why, and how. 06:33 Think about asking these types of questions to your interviewer. So, who is, who are we trying to improve Netflix for? 06:39 Or, what are we trying to improve about Netflix? When are we trying to do it? This ties back to, like, time frame for the when. 06:46 Uh, it's just a bit easier to understand or remember. So, you can could, you could remember this framework if you're having trouble coming up with clarifying questions in the moment. 06:54 Another thing that you could do here is provide multiple choice options when you're talking to the interviewer. And this demonstrates that you're leading the discussion. 07:03 Like, you are doing the mental math and the mental load of thinking about this. And then you're just getting the clarification from the interviewer. 07:10 So, an example, should I focus on feature improvements and user onboarding or engagement strategies? Um, instead of saying, what should I focus on? 07:19 You're giving them multiple choice options, um, so that they can then say, oh, you should be focused on engagement strategies. 07:25 Um, the next piece here is strategic pausing, uh, before asking the question. So, you don't want to just be like, s- uh, immediately jump into a question without thinking about it. 07:36 You want to make sure that your question is being actually thoughtful and relevant to the prompt. Um, okay, the next piece here is when to ask clarifying questions. 07:45 So, there are valid scenarios, and there are scenarios where you kind of want to avoid. So, right at the start, um, of your answer before diving into the actual answer is when you're going to want to ask those clarifying questions. 07:56 Or, if the question is vague or has m- multiple possible interpretations, um, or when additional business context or constraints are needed to provide an actual coherent answer, or if the interviewer uses unfamiliar terminology or assumptions, you're absolutely going to want to learn more with clarifying 08:14 questions, because if that's the case, you're not understanding the prompt fully, or if you need to confirm key metrics or definitions of stuff before you move on. 08:23 So, there are scenarios where you want to avoid. Avoid asking clarifying questions. So, one is over clarifying, um, you should know when to move forward confidently. 08:33 Don't just endlessly ask questions about something, like you're going to want to stop at a certain point and then move on to you taking over and really taking the lead on this answer, or unnecessary or overly obvious questions. 08:48 So, um, if that's the prompt is, uh, improve Netflix, you, you don't want to say, okay, so, uh, do you want me to improve Netflix? 08:55 Like, that would be inappropriate, of course, to ask. You're going to want to avoid these unnecessary and obvious questions. Um, another is very vague questions without a clear intent. 09:07 So, you, you, you, you don't, you never want to ask a question that is going to come off as like, what are, what is this candidate even talking about? 09:13 You, you want to make sure they're clear, that it's clear what you're trying to get out of the question from the interviewer. 09:20 The next is overly explaining the need for a clarification instead of just getting to the point and asking the questions. 09:27 So, you don't want to say, you know, I, I, I really want to understand, like, why we're trying to improve Netflix. 09:34 So, I'm curious, how should we approach Like, that's not going to come off in a, in a positive light, just get to the point, get to your clarification instead of justifying it. 09:46 Uhm, the next, you want to avoid asking questions and then not using the answers at all later in your interview. 09:53 So, if you say, you know, are we thinking about iOS, uhm, Android, or, uhm, mobile web, or desktop, or all of them, and they say, let's focus on iOS, and then, in, in the later parts of your interview, you're talking about desktop, uhm, web, for example, that's inappropriate, like, you're not using the 10:12 answers that you got in the clarifying questions to actually inform your answer. So, avoid doing all of these, and, and these scenarios above are valid scenarios where you should ask, uh, clarifying questions. 10:23 Alright, now we're going to dive into a couple examples. So, the first is a prompt which is design a birthday app. 10:31 So, you might ask, who is the primary audience for this app? Is it specifically for families, friends, companies, or can I explore multiple options here? 10:39 You might say, are there any key functions this app should focus on? Like, are we, are we thinking planning for a birthday, or reminders about people's birthdays, or purchasing gifts, or, or is this open to an end in? 10:50 You might say, are there any constraints I should consider? Um, like, the time we could spend building this app, or what platform we'd want to build this on? 10:59 Or, are we assuming this is a brand new app, or is this a part of an existing app? Uh, is it a standalone app that's already been built, but we're aiming to improve it? 11:08 Can you share more about, like, the app itself? The next prompt example is important. So, you could say, when we say improve Netflix, are, are we focusing on improving engagement, retention, or acquisition? 11:21 Or, uh, should the improvements I consider here target a specific area of Netflix, like their content, their pricing models, or any other specific feature? 11:30 You could say, are we improving Netflix for a specific type of user, like new users or long-term subscribers? Or, would you like me to, uh, to decide, uh, what, what I think is best there? 11:41 You could say, are there any important business challenges we're aiming to solve here with this exploration? Like, is there any deeper context you can give me as to why we want to improve Netflix? 11:50 Or, are there any technical or business constraints I should consider, or is the world my oyster for this exploration here? 11:58 The next and last example here is, what metrics would you use to measure sales? Success of Zoom? So, this is more of an analytical type interview question. 12:08 So, you could say, are we evaluating success from the user's perspective, or purely from a business perspective here? Or, are you interested in a particular aspect of Zoom, like their, their user acquisition, their retention, their technical performance, or, or anything else specific like that? 12:24 You could say, over what time horizon are we considering this? Are we success? Are we talking about monthly, quarterly, yearly, or over a much longer term? 12:31 And then, is there any interest in a qualitative measure here, like a CSAT score, or, or should I focus purely on quantitative measures, like retention rates, or should I consider both in this exercise? 12:45 So, the next one is, is there a specific user segment I should consider here, like, is enterprise users, or individuals? 12:52 So, these are just a couple of different example clarifying questions that you could ask, um, no matter what the prompt is, you're going to want to leverage some of those frameworks, so the who, what, when, where, why, regurgitating the prompt so that you're understanding, validating assumptions, identifying 13:10 those key ambiguities, um, so that you can effectively go out there and then answer the question based on what they're looking for and in a structured manner. 13:19 So, hopefully this helped you understand the types of clarifying questions that you should ask, and why you should be asking them. 13:26 And I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to ask effective clarifying questions in case interviews so you can narrow vague prompts, avoid wrong assumptions, and deliver aligned, structured answers.",38be529c-b787-4c66-beb0-c6a9a3ad4d12,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,How to Ask Clarifying Questions,11,TRUE,14,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:09.967395+00
3d7e1b2bc4ff4aaa81a89f070292640a,"0:00 Within this lesson, I'm going to be teaching you how to answer the tell me about yourself question with a framework. 0:06 You are guaranteed to get this question in almost any interview that you're coming across within the product management interview loop. 0:15 Interviewers at every company. You will apply will likely ask this in the format of I'd love to hear a bit more about your background or could you tell me about yourself or I've seen your resume already but would love to hear more about your background etc. 0:27 So they're all basically asking the same question of tell me about yourself. What are you looking for within this question? Based on your answer, why are you interviewing with them today? Next, they're looking for you to talk for about 2-3 minutes. This should not go on for a long time. 1:17 In general, you want to create a structured and coherent story narrative. You want the interviewer to be able to follow along and ultimately go from the intro of your answer and go through this journey of explaining, okay, I started at one point and then why did I transition to the next point. 1:37 Okay, now I'm at the next point. This experience number one where I learned these skills. Okay, then I transitioned. Why did I transition? 1:45 Add some context. Now I'm here with experience number two and I've gained additional skills there. And then why did I transition to the next thing? 1:53 Experience three, where I gained additional skills. Then ultimately, why am I here in front of you today? So I'm going to dive into this a bit more, but that's generally story arc that you're trying to portray within your answer to this question. 2:07 So within the introduction, you're setting the stage for your interviewer. Where did you start out? Consider sharing something like where you're from, what you studied in school and college, why you've always been passionate or recently become passionate about technology, and then a personal story that 2:22 relates to the company's mission or product. An example here is I've always been really interested in the healthcare space. In high school, I actually trained to be an EMT, blah blah blah. 2:32 Then you're going to go into the whys. So in between parts of your story, you're going to need to provide context on why there was a change in your career or professional journey. 2:40 In other words, what was the reason that you made a switch or a jump? Hint to learn something new and continue expanding your skill set and toolkit. 2:49 This is typically what you're going to want to convey in your, in these like why sections of your answer here. 2:56 So an example. After working in that role for two years, I realized I wanted to gain more experience with consumer facing products. 3:03 Cool. That makes a ton of sense. I was in this role, then I wanted to gain more experience with consumer facing products, which is another skill. 3:10 Now I transition experience speaking about one of your experiences. These are the, this is the meat of your story. So an experience can be a job, it can be a project, an educational program, etc. 3:21 Basically anything that was substantial in nature and that you learned from. For each experience, you're going to want to aim to share the following. 3:29 Number one, a quick overview of the company and your role within that company. Two, the transferable PM skills that you learned in that role. 3:37 Three, if applicable and strong, a very short nugget of your impact within that role. And then four, if you got promoted during your time at that company, that's definitely worthwhile. 3:45 Two, show your support. Share in an ideal world. You stack your transferable skills so that at the end of your intro, you've demonstrated you have a strong overall skill set to be an effective product manager. 3:56 A quick note on transferable skills when thinking through the skills that you've gained and upleveled in previous. Consider the following that you want to mention. 4:05 Leveraging data in decision making. Ruthlessly prioritizing for an MVP. Working cross-functionally with a bunch of different stakeholders. Communicating effectively. Time management and organization. 4:17 Problem solving. Learning from customers. Competitive analysis and then finally leading without authority. Which means being a leader on your team without actually being in an authoritative position to do so. 4:29 The conclusion is where you'll wrap things up and tie all of your experience into why you're interviewing with this team. 4:34 Company and role specifically. Explain why you're now here interviewing. Explain why you are qualified for this role. Tie the experiences and passion that you have to the role and the company. 4:47 And try to reference the company's mission, values, or products if possible. So, an example here. So, all of that leads me to today. 4:54 I'm really excited about transitioning to a PM role, and I believe I can be really effective on your team, specifically because of my past experiences in the healthcare space and the skills that I've refined over time. 5:04 Okay. The goal here is to go from this It's really looking great from the interviewer's perspective. You're full of this rich skill set and experience. 5:39 We're well branded and all of that good stuff. So to review at a high level, your answer should help to the tell me about yourself question should be one, start with this intro. 5:49 Then you're going to go this through this loop of talking about an experience and then explaining why you transitioned to the next. 6:02 And then finally, the conclusion where you're tying everything together, tying it back to the role and the company that you're applying to. 6:11 By the end of the answer, your interviewer should fully understand your journey to this current moment and view you as being uniquely qualified for the role. 6:19 Remember, first impressions are very important. Your answer to this question sets the stage for the rest of the interview. Because it's guaranteed to be at the end of the interview, you can find out more about it at the end of the video. If asked, you should be 100% prepared for it with an exceptional 6:38 answer. Alright, in the next lesson, I'm going to go over a quick example of the tell me about yourself question. 6:37 Alright, see you there.",Learn how to structure a 2–3 minute “Tell me about yourself” interview answer using a narrative framework so you can clearly show fit and qualifications.,cd54d384-5d40-4ab4-b378-5dff485228b6,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Tell Me About Yourself Framework,12,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:10.545178+00
57e2aa24c2e240dea182050c63730770,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over an example for the tell me about yourself question. So imagine the interviewer asks, could you tell me about yourself at the beginning of the interview? 0:10 I could say, sure, I would love to. So I've always been interested in technology ever since I was a kid. 0:15 I actually created a video about technology. I created a youtube channel in high school where I'd review tech software and products, and I eventually grew that to about 1.6 million views. 0:23 It always fascinated me that software could be built to basically accomplish any task or solve any problem. So within this section, I am explaining you know, I have a foundational understanding of tech, and I'm passionate about it. 0:37 Next, when I went to college, I knew I wanted to continue to learn more about technology, so I decided to study computer science. 0:43 Now I'm transitioning, I'm explaining why I went from high school, my youtube channel, to then college studying computer science. And after the first year, I was eager to take what I learned, and actually apply it and build a product. 0:56 That's around when the time I came up with the idea for my first iOS app called ChinUp. I learned the Swift programming language, built, and finally launched chin up in the app store. 1:05 It was an app that allowed people to, you know, within my college to anonymously complement each other, and I was able to eventually grow the app to 45,000 compliments being posted at my college. 1:15 Okay, the skills I'm explaining here, I'm technical in nature, I care about growth, I care about engagement. It was through that experience I actually stumbled upon product management. 1:24 Once I realized I could do this for a career, I was absolutely hooked. To continue learning, now I'm explaining why I'm transitioning, I built and launched two more apps, each focused on a different thing. 1:35 One was a job networking tool that I built. I charged a monthly subscription for. The other was a political activism app. 1:41 Okay, the skill I'm learning here is around monetization, how to actually earn revenue from software that I'm building. Through these app experiences, I learned a ton around product development, leveraging data to improve the product, and how to market apps. 1:53 I then wanted to learn product management in a more professional setting, so I got a PM internship at a health insurance company in New York City. 2:00 Okay, so I'm explaining I have experience analyzing data. I have experience marketing and developing apps. Then I'm explaining why I wanted to transition and get this additional experience. 2:12 After graduating, I was able to become an Associate PM at SeatGeek, which has a live events app. There, I really learned best practices when it comes to exceptional product design, A-B testing, and I ended up launching over 40 consumer phones. 2:25 After SeatGeek, I joined Squarespace as a product manager to continue up-leveling my product skill set at a larger organization. Okay, so, I'm explaining experiences and skills around collaboration, around design, around A-B testing. 2:41 There, I really learned how to lead without authority and ship product changes at a massive scale. At Squarespace, I was responsible for launching the first standalone product offering outside of websites called Squarespace Scheduling. 2:53 There, I also learned how to build for a different type of customer, a small business owner. At that time, I was promoted to senior PM, explaining around leadership, around scale, big scale, operating in a larger environment. 3:06 I then worked at Sagebout, a small startup focused on the creator economy. At Sagebout, my goal was to learn as much as possible about working quickly to try and find product marketing. 3:14 While in that environment, I didn't end up being very healthy, I definitely wore more hats than what I'd been used to. 3:22 Adaptability here, product market fit. More recently, I've been at Growth Therapy as a senior product manager working on their billing team. 3:29 In this role, I've been really able to work on really extremely complex and challenging insurance related systems and workflows. The team I'm on is a platform team which is allowing me to round out my overall product management toolkit. 3:41 Okay, I'm working on complex systems and platform. Which leads me to this interview. Now that I've had a breadth of product experiences in different environments and industries, I'm excited about the opportunity to lead the commerce team at Airbnb. 3:54 It has long been a passion of mine to work on consumer facing products. Combined now with my experience on the commerce team at Squarespace and the billing team at Growtherapy, I'm confident I could be a value add in this role. 4:04 Okay, see right here. I'm referencing the four vectors. I'm referencing my past experiences with RoleFit, the technology used around the billing experience, industry, consumer-facing products. 4:18 So this is an example of an overall question and answer to this question that you will almost definitely be asked in so many of your interviews. 4:30 Again, it should be around two to three minutes. You should explain all of your experiences. And say why you're transitioning in between one to give your store to give the interviewer an overall story arc of your background and why you're here interviewing today. 4:44 Alright, hope that helped.

312ed3c78e554e2d922e0edd9327e36d,"0:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over the behavioral frameworks that you can use and how to prep. So what is the point of the behavioral interview? 0:10 Interviewers are trying to understand if you would be an effective product manager and the team that they are hiring for. 0:16 Make sure you're qualified and you would be a culture fit with the team. the way they think about product development should map to the way that you think about it. 0:25 So to understand and gauge this, they'll primarily be asking you a set of questions along the lines of tell me about a time when blank. 0:32 Your goal is to share hand-picked stories from your past that paint you in a positive light. You want to be sharing stories that highlight transferable skills that you have. 0:41 Remember, it is imperative that you tell clear and concise stories in this specific interview. They need to be able to follow along. 0:48 Take away the right things from your answers. Structured framework can make a big difference. 1:07 Um, one of the popular frameworks is called STAR, but for a more comprehensive approach, I recommend and what I do for my own interviews is using the N plus STAR plus TL framework. 1:18 So, to dive into each component here. N is for nugget. This is the summary or the punchline of the story. 1:24 It's a quick one sentence overview of what happened and you can use this as a hook to grab the interviewer's attention. 1:31 Situation. This is where you're describing the context or circumstances of your story. So give enough detail so that they understand what is going on but keep it concise. 1:41 T task. This is where you explain the specific role or responsibility that you had in the situation. What were you expected to accomplish? 1:49 Action. This is where you're going through the actions that you took to address the task or problem. Be really specific and focus on what you did, not necessarily the overarching team of your boss. 1:59 Result. This is the outcome of your actions. So whenever possible within, um, when you're, when you're discussing the outcome, quantify it with, with concrete numbers or percentages. 2:09 This is going to really add a lot into your answer. Also tie it back to the user. Then take away. 2:14 Share what you learned or what insights you gained from the situation. This should, uh, shows that you're reflective and continually learning. 2:21 And then finally, learning. Um, expand on how you applied or plan to apply what you've learned. Future tasks or challenges. 2:27 This highlights your growth mindset and adaptability. So here's a quick example of the end star TL framework in action. Sure. 2:35 Let me tell you at a time that I led a cross-functional team to implement a new feature that increased user engagement by 20. 2:41 So when I was working at company X as a product manager, we noticed that although we had a large user base, engagement was lower than, you know, what we would expect compared to industry standards. 2:52 So my task was right yet to identify the opportunities that we had to increase user engagement and lead the team. 2:58 I initiated user research to understand our user needs better and worked closely with our engineers and designers to introduce a new feature based on our findings. 3:07 Within three months of launching that feature, we saw a 20% increase in daily user engagement. What I did here is that this project was instrumental for me to understand the importance of user research in guiding product decisions and the value of cross-functional collaboration in implementing those 3:23 changes. And since this project, I've continued to leverage user feedback and foster cross-functional collaboration to drive product improvements. So, this is just a very, very short example. 3:35 Your real answer should be a bit longer than this. But how you can go through this N-star-T-L framework for all these types of behavioral questions. 3:46 To better prepare you for answering these, I recommend to all candidates to come up with your 8 stories. It is impossible to anticipate every single question you may be asked in a behavioral interview, and it varies widely company to company, but it's still possible to prepare and be confident going 4:02 into this interview. So I recommend coming up with 8 stories about your past experiences that can basically answer any questions thrown at you, and they'll cover 4 categories, leadership or influence, mistakes or failures, challenges or ambiguity or where you disagreed with someone and then finally successes. 4:34 Um, this theme in general. So, uh, you know, come up with a past experience where you had, you made a mistake or where you failed. 4:41 Um, another one where you had a challenge, but overcame it. Another where it was a success story. Then within each of these sections, you're going to, um, note down the theme. 4:52 You're going to, uh, you know, title the, the name of the story so you can easily remember it. And then you're going to just go through and say, okay, what is my nugget for this story? 5:01 What was the situation? And you can just put bullet points in here. And that way you're going to be able to more easily remember the different parts of this. 5:08 It's possible, um, where you could have this in front of you in the interview on the screen, but you definitely want to make sure that you're, it doesn't look like you're, you know, just like staring up a part of the screen and reading from it. 5:20 You want it to sound natural. So I would use this as a. Cool to prepare for the interviews, but then you should get good at remembering these parts of the stories and just delivering them off the cusp. 5:30 And um, I want to note that the way that it is used, um, it, these eight stories is that after you prepare them and, and, and document them in the. 5:39 Um, but you're, um, really probably wondering how you can leverage them. So imagine you get one of these questions, describe a time when you had to manage your conflict within your team or give me an example of a project that didn't go as planned. 5:50 How did you handle that? How have you handled disagreements with leadership? These can all be answered by. One of your two challenge or ambiguity or disagreed stories. 5:59 You'll just need to slightly adjust your response to match exactly what the question is asking for. So even though within, um, this template, the overall section is challenges and they're not exactly say, tell me about it. 6:11 Challenge within a past project. Um, these are all within the same realm. So you can use the same story. Just make sure you gear your answer to actually answering this specific question. 6:23 Okay. So what are your next steps now? So next you should think through your past experience. Fill out that template with all the stories and bullet points of the highlights and then start answering them out loud using the N-Star TL framework. 6:37 Check out the PM questions and answers guide. For example, questions you may be asked in the interview in this. We'll be right back. 6:52 We'll be right back. Tell me about a time where you had to work with a difficult teammate. 6:55 How did you handle that situation? So I recommend literally out loud going through these questions, coming up with even more questions, and answering them using the stories that you come up with. 7:07 It is possible that an interviewer asks you something that completely throws you off and doesn't map to one of your prepared stories. 7:16 This will come up. Try to think in the moment back to an experience of yours that addresses this question. When answering, remember to use the N-Star TL framework to keep it structured. 7:27 To help here, in addition to the 8 stories, you can additionally write out just bullet points of projects. Just so you have it written down and you can remember back to them in terms of your overall pool of stories to pull from. 7:42 In general, what you're going to see is that the past experiences you've had came and answer almost any question thrown at you because within the, within the working world, so much comes up. 7:54 There's disagreement. There's successes. There's failures. There's things with communication. There's tracking data. There's so many different things that you will be able to answer all these questions, but. 8:04 Keep in mind that one of the most important things you can do is make sure that you are structured in your answer so that your interviewer can follow along. 8:12 And that structure maps to the n-star TL framework. Alright, in the next lesson, I will be going over an example of a behavior. 8:20 Girl, question, and answer.

652e368b8c7e45289f62e9969b8cdf8a,"0:00 Within this lesson, I'm going to go over an example answer to a behavioral question. So imagine that you are asked this question. 0:08 Give me an example of a project that did not go as planned. How did you handle that? Sure. So, so I'll start with the nugget. 0:15 Sure. Let me tell you about a time when I launched a redesigned version of the general admissions event page of the Seakeak iOS app. 0:23 Now into the situation. To provide some context, Seakeak again is a live events ticketing app. Think Broadway, sports, etc. At the time, I was an associate PM on their mobile phone. 0:32 Their app had two versions of the event page where people could find tickets. That's the seated event page and then the general admissions event page. 0:41 When analyzing the data, I noticed that our checkout conversion rate for the GA general admissions event page was a lot lower than the. 0:48 Seated event page. And then when I looked at the product, I realized the design was very basic and hadn't been touched in a really long time. 0:55 So I saw this as an opportunity for us to increase our conversion rate, which was one of our main OKRs that quarter. 1:02 So after just some discussion with the team. And we, We made it our goal to increase the conversion rate of the general admissions event page by redesigning it and running it as an A-B test. 1:12 It was my responsibility to work with our designer and mobile engineering team to launch a more inviting, higher converting events page. 1:19 So our work was broken down into, to three main phases. One was design, two was develop, three was test. So for the first phase of design, I worked with the designer to create a version of the GA page that asked quantity upfront and really emphasized the cheapest set of tickets for pre-selecting it. 1:37 And bringing the checkout button earlier in the funnel. For GA events, the only thing that users care about is the cheapest ticket, since it's the same across all seats. 1:46 Next, I worked with one of our iOS engineers to implement the feature, ensuring it was consistent with our designs and had the right analytics in it. 1:53 And finally, we launched the updated design as an A-B test. Unfortunately, I soon realized that the updated version of the event page was actually performing worse. 2:03 I was shocked. It looked so much better visually compared to the old version, but somehow fewer people were checking me out. 2:09 So, I decided to invite some users into our New York headquarters and run some user interviews. We quickly learned a lot about different pitfalls of the user experience we had designed. 2:20 Two major findings were that 1. People usually go to GA events with friends, and their ultimate goal is to get the cheapest possible tickets for the entire group. 2:28 Customers didn't mind purchasing multiple sets of tickets that added up to their whole group quantity if that meant it would cost less overall. 2:37 So, by pre-filtering the tickets, we ended up inadvertently introducing friction to the experience by decreasing the quantity of cheap tickets shown. 2:47 Secondly, people want to know that they're getting a good deal. They like to shop around first. By really emphasizing the cheapest ticket and bringing forward the checkout button, we actually hurt the customer's experience. 2:57 Because they weren't able to truly feel like they were getting the best deal. So I worked with the designer to make some slight tweaks to the experience. 3:05 We no longer pre-selected the cheapest ticket, but instead highlighted it that it was the best deal. We also didn't filter down based on quantity, instead allowed users to shop around themselves. 3:15 To my delight, the second iteration after performing this research and making design tweaks ended up increasing our conversion rates against the overall version of the page. 3:24 Adapting and quickly iterating was really important to turning this feature around our original goal of increasing conversion despite taking a little bit longer than initially planned. 3:36 I'll always remember the value in derisking a product solution as early and cheaply as possible. And since then, my first thought when an idea pops up is how can we quickly test this with research. 3:47 Alright, so that was an example of how you can go through the n-star TL framework to answer one of those types of behavioral questions that you're asked from an interviewer. 3:57 In the next lesson, I'm going to dive into product design and product sense. See you there.",Learn how to structure a “project didn’t go as planned” behavioral interview answer using the N-STAR framework so you can clearly explain your actions and results.,0c2802ec-5a99-4bc8-a3fb-283cb1c9bc6e,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Behavioral Example,15,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:12.053329+00
dd5c14f4a246493d95e209538b2c9bf0,"00:00 Welcome to the lesson on product design and product sense. This is the meat of the product management interview. This is one of the most important ones, and it's also one of the more exciting ones to do. 00:10 So, let's dive in. What are they testing for in this interview? In the product designer products. They're trying to engage a couple things, whether or not you have the skill set to effectively build high performing products, that you can break down a very vague or ambiguous task into discrete steps 00:27 that build on top of one another, that you can think about solving a problem in a structured way. That you're able to take several considerations into account when building a product and that you're able to communicate your ideas in a coherent and concise way. 00:42 So a couple example questions that you may be asked in the product sense interview. Improve Airbnb. Period. How would you increase engagement for YouTube shorts? 00:53 Imagine you're the PM for Amazon's checkout page. How would you improve it? Design an alarm clock for someone who is deaf. 00:59 This list is not even close to exhaustive. You may be asked about literally any products that you can think of. 01:05 The goal here is for you to learn the framework that you can leverage to answer any of these types of questions effectively. 01:12 Now, it's important to take into account the grading rubric. As you can see here, the product design and product sense one is up at the top. 01:21 Go through all the different skills here just to explain a little bit more about them. Let me zoom in. So number one is questions. 01:29 You're going to want to ask really insightful and targeted questions at the beginning of your response. You want to understand the context and the constraints. 01:37 And you'll use the answers that they give you to refine your approach. You, as you're going through things, you want to communicate things very clearly, articulate ideas and rationales. 01:47 You'll want to engage the interviewer actively. You're going to demonstrate that you're listening to them and adjust communication. In terms of business, you want to identify and prioritize the business objectives. 01:59 You want to articulate the impact that your work will be having on the business and align product ideas tightly with these objectives. 02:06 From a user perspective and user empathy. You want to demonstrate that you have a deep understanding of what a user really needs. 02:14 You want to craft personas or examples that are really relatable and comprehensive, and you're going to want to consider multiple different types of users. 02:22 Solutions. You want to propose innovative but feasible solutions. You want to show how solutions meet the business objectives and user needs, and consider both short and long-term impact. 02:33 Within product vision, you want to articulate a compelling and innovative vision. You want to tie this vision to both business and user needs. 02:41 You want to think Thank you. Several steps ahead. Trade-offs and pitfalls. You want to clearly identify potential trade-offs with the solution that you come up with. 02:49 You want to provide strong rationale for the choices that you're making. You want to justify things, and you want to consider pros and cons. 02:55 And then finally creativity and product passion. As you're going through this exercise, you should demonstrate really great enthusiasm for the product and the role. 03:05 You want to offer creative and out-of-the-box solutions, and you want it to be really clear that you have a passion for problem-solving. 03:19 Alright, so here's the product design or product sense framework. It can be used to answer any of these types of questions in a structured way. 03:28 Number one is goal and mission. It can be used to define the goal of your project. Users define and choose a user segment to focus on. 03:36 Pain points define and choose a pain point to focus on of the user segment that you chose. Feature ideas. You want to ideate solutions to the chosen pain point and then you want to prioritize them. 03:47 So choose the solution that you would prioritize and then you can speak to rolling it out. Pitfalls and trade-offs. Call out any pitfalls and potential trade-offs with the solution that you're proposing. 03:58 And then finally metrics. Define metrics to measure the success of your solution. Okay. In terms of the structure of your answer, when you're answering it in a real interview, you're going to want to do so in a structured manner and frequently check in with the interviewer. 04:13 So overall, it's going to be something like you're going to ask clarifying questions at the beginning. You're going to then outline. 04:18 And then for each step, you're going to pause, brainstorm a bit, you know, by yourself, present and then check in. 04:27 And then finally at the end, you're going to summarize everything for the interviewer. Alright, so now I'm going to dive into an example of the, the prompt Improve Google Maps, and I'm going to go through all these different sections, what you should be including in them, and then provide the example 04:42 as to answer this, this example prompt. So, number one is Ask Clarifying Questions. Imagine you are literally the product manager the product you're asked about. 04:52 The first natural thing to do, if you were actually asked this question at your job, like, say you're a PM at Google and you were asked by your, the executive to improve Google Maps, I, I mean, you would have questions from your questions and then answers to those questions. 05:07 You'll learn more about the problem, which will ultimately help you as you go through the rest of your answer. So think about it as an onion. 05:13 You're trying to peel back a few layers so that you have a well-defined problem. You should ask about the scope of the prompt, so how expansive or small should you be thinking? 05:25 Are we an unlimited resource team, or are we a startup? Where you should consider the solution will exist. Are we talking everywhere, mobile versus desktop? 05:35 Are we talking about physical versus software solutions? Ask these clarifying questions. So here are a couple example questions and how the script could go. 05:45 So you. That's an interesting prompt. Before I jump in, I do have a couple questions to ask if that's all right. 05:51 Of course. Thanks. First, I'd love to understand if there. Excuse me. Is a preference if I focus on the desktop or native mobile experience? 05:59 No preference for us. Okay. In that case, I think I'll focus on the native mobile with an assumption that the majority of our usage occurs on native mobile. 06:06 Does that sound good? Yeah, that that works. Awesome. And when you say improve Google Maps, is there a specific piece or area of Google Maps I should focus on or is all of Google Maps up for grabs? 06:17 They'll say all of it is. Okay, that's great. I'll think expansively of the experience. Last question, in terms of resourcing for this project, are there any constraints that I should consider? 06:27 Your solution should take less than a quarter. Okay, perfect. Alright, I'm going to jot down some notes if that's okay. 06:33 Yup, that's it for the questions. Now, next, outline your process. You're going to want to share your process with the interviewer. 06:40 Remember, they are looking for structure. Bye. Outlining the process you plan to follow and then clearly announcing each stage of the process as you go through solving the problem, your interviewer is going to view you as a structured thinker and communicator. 06:55 So, you could say something like, okay, so first I'm going to define a goal for this project. Then, I'm going to identify some user segments to consider, I'll choose one to focus on. 07:05 Then, I'll brainstorm pain points for that user segment, brainstorm solutions to those pain points, chat through any tradeoffs to consider, and if we have time at the end, I'll chat through any metrics. 07:14 Does that overall sound good to you? Then, they'll say yes. Next, goal and mission. Setting a goal is really critical as a foundation for the rest of your answer. 07:24 Everything you say and should do should tie back to the goal that you set. So, your goal should map well to the mission of the company. 07:32 As the PM at the company you're asked about, the work you're doing should always align to their mission, vision, and strategy. 07:38 So to break down what your goal should be, it's a couple things. One, measurable. You want something that can be quantified and ultimately calculated. 07:47 Clear. And so an example of a goal that would be bad is, we want to make users happy. Okay, well, that's a great goal, but how are you actually going to measure that? 07:56 What does that mean in practice? And you have to make sure that that's clear. Clear. Keep it simple. Interviewers are not looking for very complex measures. 08:05 Scoped down. You're not trying to boil the ocean. The more specific you can get, the better. And then, ultimately tied to the mission and strategy, your goal should make sense in the context of this company. 08:15 Company. When you're presenting the goal to the interviewer, mention the mission of the company, even if it's paraphrasing. And if you're trying to come up with it on the spot. 08:28 So, as we know, Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful. Within those confines, I think the last part is really important. 08:39 Making information useful. For Google Maps, that's especially important because users are typically in an acute need of location information. So, here I'm scoping things down. 08:50 So, I think the goal here is going to be increased users. I think that metric tracks how effective we are at supporting users, in other words, making information useful when they want to start a trip. 09:04 So, I'm tying it back to the ultimate mission, making information useful and accessible. Alright, so next, we're going to go into the user section. 09:13 Within the user portion of your answer, you should brainstorm three different user segments and pick one to base the rest of your answer on. 09:20 Your user segment should provide focus to your solution and ultimately relate to the company's mission. Consider the following options to break down the user base. 09:29 Within the realm of demographics, you could look at life stage. So are they an early adult, mid adult, late adult, etc. 09:35 Their gender, their education, income, or family status. Geographic, you could split it down by gender. A country, a region, or urban vs rural, or climates. 09:45 Tech, people using mobile vs desktop, iOS vs Android, or the channel that they arrived at your platform on. Instagram vs organic. 09:53 Psychographics like lifestyle, interests, personalities, or values. Behavioral, like their usage rate or purchase behavior. So you might want to work on a solution for users who have only purchased one thing in the last six months and you're not going to be solving a problem for users who have bought 10:10 ten things in the last several months. Employment status, student, part-time employed, full-time employed, etc. And then other like health condition or holiday users, stuff like that. 10:22 So these are just an example of all the different ways that you can break down the user base, but you're ultimately going to want to break it down into three categories. 10:32 So this is what an example could look like for this prompt. Okay, so I brainstormed a couple user segments. If I had some more resources or data, I could break better brainstorm here, but without that, I'd love to share what I came up with. 10:43 So I decided to break it down by job type. Reason being is that most adults aged 18 to 70 are working a job of some sort. 10:50 So it covers a vast amount of people, but each cohort has very different needs. Okay, so first we have students. 10:57 Full-time students have part-time gigs, so they may be commuting to classes, to work, or to have fun. Next, we have 9 to 5 employees. 11:04 These are full-time adults commuting typically to an office for 8 hours, around 8 to 4, or 9 to 5. And then next we have remote workers. 11:12 These individuals primarily work from home, but they may have occasional needs to visit client sites. Next is transportation professionals, like truck drivers, delivery personnel, and taxi drivers. 11:27 Their livelihoods depend on efficient navigation, and they have specific requirements like large vehicle routes, loading zones, and timing. And lastly, a crucial segment we identified is first responders, which includes police, fire, and EMS. 11:42 The core focus for this segment is the need for rapid and accurate navigation. Every second counts for them, and specialized features could be a huge deal. 11:50 Because there are first responders in every single town and city in America and globally, I think this would be a worthwhile segment to focus on. 11:59 They have specific needs, and those needs are likely not being met by Google Maps' mostly consumer-facing features today. So, I'm going to start with the first responder, and I'm going to start with the first responder user. 12:27 So, within this overall brainstorm, you paused and you took some time to just write down these things. You had students, you had 9-5 employees, remote workers, transportation professionals, and then finalizing. 12:38 Then you decided, okay, let's focus in on the first responders because of these reasons. You justified it. And then you checked in with your interviewer to make sure that they were aligned with focusing on that user segment. 12:52 Alright, now, pain points. Now that you are have chosen this user segment, you're going to brainstorm pain points or problems that they have in their lives as it relates to the product you're focused on. 13:04 And that's a crucial part. Like, you're not trying to solve all the problems for first responders like having the right equipment in their truck. 13:12 You're, you're specifically thinking about what are the pain points as it relates to our product, in this case Google Maps or Navigation. 13:20 So think about the context in which they're using your product. What were they doing before that prompted them to use the product? 13:27 What problem are they trying to solve? What is their goal? How fast do they want to achieve that goal? And what do they want to be doing after using your product? 13:35 Come up with three to six problems and then pick one or group them together and pick a group. Pick the most painful or highest leverage pain point that relates to your goal and then share all the problems and the justification for choosing one or a group of some. 13:50 So I'm going to go into an example here. Okay, so I identified a couple pain points that these first responder users may face. 13:57 Number one is around a delay in location updates. Real-time updates like changing traffic patterns can sometimes lag and it causes first responders to lose precious seconds or even minutes of time. 14:08 Number two is route optimization. Standard routes may not be the best routes for emergency vehicles which can ignore certain traffic rules. 14:15 And number three is limited offline capabilities. Imagine being in an area where signal is poor but you're actively working an emergency situation and you have to go somewhere. 14:25 Number four is slow input of the destination. If there's no integration with like a dispatch system, first responders are going to have to manually enter locations. 14:34 These pain points are a bit different from one another so I'm going to pick one to focus a solution on. 14:38 Delay and location updates, route optimization, and slow input of destination are all pain points that if solved will definitely decrease time to start. 14:46 However, they're not as nearly as painful as limited offline activities. The problems associated with limited offline capabilities in an emergency situation are tenfold compared to route optimization. 14:58 It's the difference between seconds to minutes optimizations vs 10 plus more minutes driving around trying to figure out where to go. 15:05 So, because the stakes are so much higher for that problem, I'm going to focus in on it. I acknowledge this may not be a frequent problem, however, it is a severe and acute problem that, if solved well, will also lead to great user retention for these first responders. 15:20 People don't get good insurance because their house is on fire every day. Okay, so now that you've selected a pain point, or a grouping of pain points, it's time to brainstorm solutions to that pain point. 15:31 Remember, this process is supposed to mimic what you would actually do as a real product manager. At this phase of the typical product development process, this is what you would be doing. 15:41 So your feature ideas or solutions should all solve the problem and pain point you choose. They should be unique and not an existing solution within the product. 15:49 They should also be realistic within the constraints you're working with. And they should match your ultimate goal. Make sure you ultimately represent or present around 3-5 feature ideas. 15:59 And one of those ideas should be really big in nature, like a big bet. This is just something that the interviewers will look for, to say, okay can this person, can this candidate think about a small MVP idea, and a huge idea that would really change things? 16:14 And so it's good to include like a big bet in there. Alright, now we'll dive into the example for feature ideas. 16:21 Alright, so let's tackle the issue of limited offline capabilities for first responders, which is very critical given that they may operate in areas with low or no internet connectivity. 16:31 Here are three different product solutions that can address the problem. Number one is frequent caching of routes and traffic patterns. 16:38 Right now, Google Maps offers the ability to download offline. But you can't download route or traffic patterns. This feature would work on a rolling basis, kind of continually downloading and replacing route and traffic information as it changes so that the moment a first responder loses signal, they 16:56 at least have an accurate backup of the transcript. However, in the event they may lose signal, no worries, the route was already pre-loaded based on the info they had, so this would save critical time starting the trip during the emergency response. 17:25 And the last idea is more of a big bet, but it could be an interesting to leverage drone technology to scout for real-time information and have them communicate directly with the emergency vehicles and then ultimately the Google Maps device, maybe by Bluetooth. 17:38 For example, drones could be deployed quickly to gauge traffic patterns on certain routes and communicate back to vehicles. Which can then be synced to Google Maps via Bluetooth or wifi. 17:48 First responders are already leveraging drone technology during emergency responses, so this could be a natural enhancement. This idea, however, without stating the obvious, would be much larger undertaking compared to the two other ideas. 18:00 Okay, so now that we've got the idea, you've presented the feature ideas to your interviewer, you've paused, you've checked in, um, now what you're going to do is demonstrate your prioritization skills and choose the feature that you would end up implementing with your team. 18:13 Make sure during this section to communicate why you are giving something a specific rating. So you could use a trimmed down version out of Rice framework for your prioritization. 18:23 This is one of the frameworks that I taught in the PM Fundamentals program. And so the two vectors here, this trimmed down version would be impact and effort. 18:33 Where in impact, there's low, low impact, medium, and high, then effort is low, medium, high as well. And then at the end, what you're going to do is just divide the impact score divided by the effort score. 18:44 And then you're going to get up a total and you're going to want to choose the one that has the highest score, which means the highest impact for the lowest amount ever. 18:52 So just an example here of what you could write down is, you know, if you have these four features, low impact for the first one and medium impact, one divided by two is half. 19:02 For the second idea, it's high impact, but also high effort. So I think this is going to be a, you know, one for total prioritization versus the third idea is a three huge impact, but low effort, which means a three overall. 19:16 Okay. So an example of going through this. All right, let's dive into prioritizing these solutions. Using a simplified rice framework, focusing really on impact and effort. 19:26 If I had more time and resources, I would likely use the full rice framework and collaborate with my team to ensure alignment. 19:32 But for now, I'll be making some educated guesses here and there and making some assumptions. Asking of route and traffic patterns. 19:40 The impact. The feature here addresses a critical pain point for first responders, allowing them to start a reliable and updated trip quickly while offline. 19:50 Therefore, I'd give it a high impact rating so that's a 3. Effort front. The functionality to download maps already exists. 19:58 This would require some tweaking and automation for route and traffic pattern caching, so I'd say it's a medium effort. So that's a 2. 20:05 3 divided by 2 is a 1.5 for this score. In terms of impact, this feature directly saves critical time for first responders by pre-loading the next essential destination. 20:19 However, it's possible that it pre-loads the wrong destination, which may actually slow down the trip start. So with the right user experience, it's possible. 20:26 I think this will help on the whole, but it may not impact every single trip. So I'd rate this as a medium impact or a two. 20:33 In terms of effort, this involves creating user flows to pre-load preferred emergency destinations, or we could leverage AI to come up with and load several destinations. 20:42 It's complex but not overly so, so I'd say it's a medium effort, a two. Two divided by two here is one for the total score for plan ahead feature. 20:52 Drone technology for real time info. The potential impact here could be enormous if leveraged properly. Drones could provide hyper accurate real time data that could be life saving in emergency situations. 21:04 However, there's a lot that's unknown here and we don't know if this could work in local locations or all, you know, situations. 21:10 So I'd say it has potential to be a medium impact on impacting the offline experience. Considering the regulatory hurdles, partnerships, and technology challenges, this would be a high effort project, so a 3 if not a 4. 21:24 In total, 2 divided by 4 is a 0.5 for this one. This is the highest impact, lowest effort feature we can build within 1 quarter as you mentioned in. 21:47 It's going to help first responders who may find themselves dealing with no or low service start to start a reliable and optimized route, which could save critical time in this situation to they, that they might find themselves in. 22:01 As for the other two solutions, I'd like to quickly add these to our backlog or list of considerations for future because I think it still could add value for the overall user segment. 22:11 Okay, now that you have picked a specific solution, now you want to go into pitfalls and tradeoffs. You've laid out a goal. 22:19 You've laid, you've decided on users, pain points, and chosen a solution. You want to demonstrate that you have the ability to think about pros and cons for the solutions that you come up with. 22:29 So, tradeoffs. Giving up one benefit in order, you know, what is a tradeoff? Giving up one benefit in order to gain enough. 22:37 Choosing one feature and benefit or approach over another because you have limited resources such as time, money, or manpower. In terms of pitfalls, these are hidden or unexpected problems or challenges or disadvantages that come with a particular question. 22:52 So if something that could go wrong often in a way you didn't anticipate. So, an example of walking through a couple different pitfalls and trade-offs with this solution. 23:03 So, it's worth noting that there are three pitfalls and trade-offs that come to mind immediately. Number one is around data storage. 23:11 It is quite possible that in order to facilitate this feature functionality, we'd end up using a ton of local storage on the first responders device which could backfire if they don't actually have a lot of available storage. 23:23 Number two. In a similar line of thinking, because we'd be doing frequent updates, it's possible we'd really drain their battery. 23:29 This might not be an issue if their phones will likely be charging in the vehicle, but something to consider for sure. 23:36 Finally, it's possible that we find after releasing cached routes and traffic data, we don't actually speed up time to start. 23:42 Trips because it ends up being too stale. We will have wasted time and resources building this feature for it to not have a major impact. 23:49 So if I were the PM here, I would try to de-risk the solution, primarily by collecting additional network coverage and route data, and perform an analysis with our data teams before moving forward. 23:59 Within this example, I'm going through with a critical lens thinking about the solution that I've come up with. Okay, now you've made it to the end. 24:07 Metrics. Metrics is the bow to tie everything together for your project. As mentioned, throughout the entire program, data is a really important aspect of product management. 24:17 So this is your time to demonstrate that data is top of mind and you know how to leverage it in your decision making. 24:22 Your metrics should measure success of your chosen feature. They should tie back to your goal. They should be easily quantified. 24:28 And they should be clear to the interviewer. When presenting the metric, mention your plan for how you would track it and what you would do with different outcomes. 24:36 Also consider including counter metrics, which are basically metrics to identify if something unintended has occurred. So here's an example. We'll see you all again. Going through metrics because of these potential pitfalls, it's really critical that we would track how successful or unsuccessful this 24:51 feature would be. I would like the A-B test this feature with our user segment and the NorthStar metric I would be tracking would be the average time it takes between app open and starting a trip. 25:00 If we're successful with the app, we'll be able to do that. If average time increases in the test group, that's indicative of this new feature adding friction or confusion to first responders and we want to roll the back back the feature and reconsider it. 25:15 In terms of counter metrics I'd like to, I'd likely look at the rate at which these users end their sessions. 25:21 It's possible that in an emergency situation first responders end up abandoning google maps all together for an alternative navigation app like apple maps. 25:29 We would be able to tell if this is happening by looking at the frequency in which these users close the app within 60 seconds. 25:35 Now, it's time to summarize your entire process into a quick overview. It reinforces the path you took to get to this answer, and your ability to break down vague problems or prompts into steps that ultimately result in a visual feature idea. 25:51 So, the goal here was to improve Google Maps by way of decreasing the time it takes to start a trip. 25:57 I decided to focus in on first responders because I believe that they really have unique unmet needs and there's a lot of them across the globe. 26:05 Performing several different pain points, I decided that limited offline functionality is a major threat to the success of first responders and ultimately their saddest action with Google Maps. 26:15 I believe that this route and traffic of caching a feature idea could be really impactful to this segment and it's something we could ship within the quarter. 26:23 And to make sure that we're successful while doing it, I'd want to A.B. Test it and track the time it takes to start a trip from the app open. 26:31 Do you have any questions or can I clarify anything further? Awesome. So we made it to the end of the answer. 26:38 Just to recap, within this answer, you're going to break down the problem into these specific steps. You're starting broad, you're, you know, you know, going smaller and smaller. 26:47 And as you're doing this, you're pausing, you're writing down on a piece of paper, your thoughts for about 30 to 60 seconds. 26:53 And then you're presenting everything to the, the interviewer. You're asking the interviewer questions along the way. You're checking in with them to make sure they are actually on board with what you're saying and they're not confused in any way. 27:06 I want to emphasize that practice with this type of, problem and all the other PM interviews makes perfect. Practice really does make perfect. 27:15 So I want you to go and practice a ton of these different questions. Literally sit and, and watch, you know, open up your photo booth app or Zoom or Google Meets and talk in to the camera, write things down on a piece of paper, actually go through the entire process of answering this type of question 27:32 and then we'll set up some mock interviews to, to help you out. All right. In the next lesson, I'm going to be going over the technical interview, so I'll see you there.",Learn how to use a structured product sense framework to answer ambiguous product design interview questions so you can propose prioritized solutions with clear trade-offs and metrics.,3a9dfa11-e586-4960-bb85-5d6364926290,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Product Design / Product Sense,16,TRUE,28,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:12.658013+00
daa0f9d10bfc4ba5881465ab4ae2aba2,"0:00 Welcome to Lesson 11 on the Technical Interview. So what are they testing for you here? Technical interviews are more commonly conversational in nature to answer the questions. 0:12 One, do you have a strong understanding of tech and how software is built? And two, are you able to effectively work with and lead an engineering team? 0:20 Why are they asking you and testing you for these two things? Well, collaborating with engineers is a critical, if not the most critical, part of a PM's job. 0:28 If the company you're interviewing with has a technical interview, they really value a strong relationship with their engineering counterparts. They want to ensure that you're going to be a good culture fit with their engineering culture. 0:41 Do, so I'm going to dive into these two. Do you have a strong understanding on how technology understanding of technology and how software is built? 0:48 In a technical interviewer of this nature are trying to gauge whether your understanding of the fundamentals of technology are strong enough to be effective on their team. 0:59 So some example questions within this realm could be, can you explain what an API is and why it's important? Or what is the difference between front end and back end development? 1:09 Or can you explain the differences between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? How do you think about tech debt? Can you type a query on google.com? 1:17 Describe what happens from the point you hit enter to the point you get the results. Let's say your company's website is loading really slowly. 1:24 What might be some causes? How could you get it to load faster? What is a recent technology you learned about that interests you? 1:30 They're really just trying to get a sense of how familiar are you with technology? Do you understand it? Can you speak intelligently to it? 1:41 Or is it going to be a really big struggle working with your engineers and in that case it's going to be a bit of a red flag. 1:47 So the next is, are you able to effectively work with and lead an engineering team? So within this question, interviewers are trying to gauge whether you'll be able to work well with the engineers. 1:58 So a couple example questions here. What's your process look like when working with engineers on a new feature? Can you tell me about a time you disagreed with an engineer on how a feature should work? 2:08 What would you do? If someone reported a bug to you, describe how you would resolve conflict on a team. Can you share a time when you influenced an engineering team? 2:17 So these are all types of questions that are examples that of ways that interviewers are trying to gauge if you'd be able to collect. 2:25 You know, accurately and, and efficiently work with the engineering team. So now I'll just go through the grading rubric, a rubric for the technical interview here. 2:35 So I'm going to zoom in a little bit. So technical proficiency, an exceptional score here would mean that you really understand complex technical, technical concepts. 2:44 You demonstrate a strong understanding of the software development cycle and you're able to answer all the questions accurately. Cross-functional communication, you communicate technical ideas clearly and effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. 2:57 Analytical skills, you quickly analyze technical problems with data, propose solutions supported by logical reasoning and evidence. Critical thinking, you're proactively identifying potential challenges and solutions. 3:09 You're thinking multiple steps ahead and you question all the assumptions. So, if you're applying for a specific role like an iOS or, you know, mobile engineering team, product manager position, you have an expert level understanding of that specific domain. 3:23 Can you understand, stand, and discuss platform-specific best practices? And then finally trade-offs, edge cases, and errors? Can you clearly identify trade-offs with a solution, different edge cases that you can account for, and errors? 3:35 You will provide strong rationale for choices and solutions. Okay, if you don't know the answer for a question within a technical interview don't, don't worry. 3:46 It's best to say something along the lines of, that is a really good question. I actually don't know enough about that topic, so I wouldn't want to say anything inaccurate here but I would love to do research after our interview. 3:56 And you know, you might want to add, you know, in practice if I'm, you know, on a team in something like this. 4:02 Comes up, I'm really going to want to lean on the engineers on my team for, for, you know, collaboration within this realm and, and just try to have a conversation. 4:11 Be upfront. You know, this isn't going to tank your, your interview. But what would take your interview is if you make something up. 4:18 And lie and try to scrape by if you don't actually know the answer. So here are some tips to succeed in a technical interview. 4:26 There's a couple of things you can do. One is understand the POV of engineers. They're really good at figuring out how to build something. 4:34 They want you as the PM to figure out what to build. Make sure you emphasize that your goal in collaborating with engineers is to create space for them to build the best solution. 4:44 Number two is be very structured. Engineers think in code, meaning whatever they are thinking about a new feature, a refactor, or a developer. Whatever they're thinking in the details about exactly how it would work. 4:54 So it's important to deliver structured answers to engineers so that they can follow along and know that you're also thinking about things in a structured and detailed manner. 5:02 If you do this, they're going to think of you as a great thought partner and someone they're going to want to work with. 5:07 Don't answer, and I just said this, don't answer something you're unsure about. Engineers will be able to see right through you if you're speaking out a topic that you're unfamiliar with. 5:15 They'll end up taking points away because of this. When in doubt, admit that you aren't familiar with a topic yet, but that you are very eager to learn. 5:23 So, be upfront and honest about it. Okay, so now I'm going to go into a couple different examples of questions that you may be asked and then what you could say as your answer. 5:32 So, what is the difference between a front end and a back end? That's a great question. So, at a high level, a front end is what users see and answer. 5:42 So, I like to think of it in terms of, like, an analogy. If you imagine a restaurant, you have the table that customers are sitting at and then everything else that is happening to support that table. 5:54 For example, there are hosts Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week. Bringing customers to the table. There are chefs cooking meals. 5:58 There are waiters bringing those meals to the table. In this analogy, the table is basically the front end. It's where the users are interacting with the product, which is, in this case, the food. 6:08 The kitchen and staff represent the back end. They're performing. They're offering services to deliver the product to the user so that the user can interact with it. 6:16 It's worth noting that a restaurant would not be able to function without these two parts. Without the kitchen and staff, no food would be produced. 6:22 And without any tables, no food would be eaten. They work together to deliver a product. Next, let's say your company's website is loading really slowly. 6:32 What might be some causes for it? And how could you get it to load faster? Okay, that's a really interesting question. 6:39 First off, it's really important that our website is loading fast. In terms of potential reasons, it could be slow at loading slowly. 6:52 A couple of things come to mind. Number one, the site may be trying to load a ton of non-optimized content. 6:58 For example, if it's loading pictures and each picture is 20 megabytes, it's going to take forever. Number two, there could be a lot of back-end functions going on and added up all together, it slows things down. 7:10 Excuse me, there would likely be an opportunity to optimize there. Finally, it's possible that the website is escape- experiencing some type of outage. 7:18 Maybe one of the back-end services not working properly, which is ultimately impacting the user experience. I think if I were a PM in this situation, I would really work closely with my engineering counterparts to diagnose the underlying issue with investigations and collecting data before- ultimately 7:32 trying to come up with a strategy to resolve it. The next question is what's your process like when working with engineers on a new feature? 7:41 The answer could be, I love that question because working with engineers represents the most important function a PM can perform. 7:48 This process is composed of three main parts, one scoping, two implementation, and then three launching. Let me dive into each of those components. 7:56 Number one again is scoping. In this stage of the product development process, I want to collaborate closely with my engineering counterparts to scope the feature. 8:04 How will it work? What edge cases do we need to take into account? What happens when a user clicks a certain button? 8:09 What aspects of the project may take longer than I anticipated that we should consider cutting from scope? This part of the project is critical as a foundation for the rest of the project. 8:21 During this phase, my main goal is ensuring that the engineers remain unblocked and are able to continue building the feature as initially planned. 8:28 This involves staying close to the implementation and asking on a frequent basis if there are any blockers that I can help remove. 8:36 In other words, an engineer doesn't know what will happen in a certain scenario, and either myself as the PM or designer needs to decide. 8:44 Another example could be a change that is required on another team that hasn't completed yet, and I can work to unblock that. 8:50 Finally, number three is launch. This is the process I will be working closely with the engineers on my team to ensure that we have a launch plan created, we have correct analytics and monitoring in place to ensure our launch is successful, and that all the stakeholders are made aware of the launch. 9:05 I'll work with them to then actually launch the feature with this that's turning on a feature flag or releasing new code to production. 9:12 Then I'll stay close to the analytics and monitors to ensure everything is working properly. Overall, collaborating closely with engineers is so critical to the success of our product, and I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate with you and other engineers. 9:25 Okay, so practice makes perfect. Run through the different questions in the, in the Google Doc that I put together of different questions and answers, and try to answer these out loud. 9:36 The more that you practice, the better you're going to get at answering these questions, especially the more to protect people. 9:44 All right, let me know if you have any questions, and I'll see you in the next one!

68381563165e4c4aa25e6a829f3384fb,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to be going over the analytics and execution interviews. So, within these interviews, what are they testing you for? 00:08 They're trying to identify your level of skill when it comes to data generally. Do you understand how to track data in metrics? 00:14 Can you leverage data in your tools? Decision making process. Can you come up with a reasonable and effective metric to track the feature success of features? 00:24 How do the metrics you come up with tie to strategies and goals? Do you have the ability to understand the business fundamentals and to find metrics to measure success around? 00:32 It so there's generally two types of questions that you may be asked identifying key performance indicators or KPI's for your team so questions Within the realm of how do you measure success for your product? 00:45 What exact data points with you? Would you measure and why and then? Performing root cause analyses so for example the conversion rate of insert funnel here is down 20% What would you do or the volume of a key metric is down by a thousand a month? 00:59 What would you do? So for one identify KPIs the goal for these types of questions? Thank you for watching. I'm going to look at the user segments their journey Thank you for watching. 01:21 What is the goal of the product? You're going to brainstorm different metrics and then you're going to choose a north star supporting KPIs and then counter metrics and then at the end you're going to go through tradeoffs. 01:31 Okay, so I just wanted to quickly cover the grading Rubik. Rubik for the analytics or execution. . Interview just to give an understanding of the types of things that they would be looking for. 01:41 So within data literacy, you're going to demonstrate exceptional understanding of data analytics tools and methods able to interpret complex data effortlessly within metrics. 01:50 You easily identify KPIs and know how to utilize them to make informed decisions. Goals, you're able to set achievable yet challenging goals, aligning them with short-term and long-term business objectives. 02:02 Root cause analysis, you can excel in identifying the root cause of different issues and provide insightful solutions. We'll see you next week. We'll see you next week. When you're doing all this, you're clearly articulating ideas and rationales. 02:14 You're engaging the interviewer. Within the realm of questions you ask insightful and targeted questions you seek to understand context and learn more. 02:21 Prioritization, you are exceptional at prioritizing tasks based on impact. Acting feasibility, aligning them perfectly with business objectives. Executionability, you are implementing plans flawlessly showing a strong understanding of each step's impact. 02:36 And then collaboration, you're able to collaborate with cross functional teams enhancing productivity and solving problems. Collectively, so these are just generally the types of skills that they may be assessing you for in an analytics or execution interview. 02:48 So to go into this first example question of, again, this first question type of identify KPIs, how would you measure the success of Airbnb? 02:57 Thank you for your time. Okay, this is a broad question. So we're gonna work to break it down. Number one is asking questions. 03:04 So similarly other interviews, you should start with clarifying questions. Consider asking questions that help you to better understand the scope of this question. 03:11 Should you think about the entire product or part of the product? Should you think about the product's performance in a specific region or everywhere? 03:18 Should you think about the product's performance for a specific user type like buyer, seller, administrator, viewer, internal employee, etc. So what you could say here? 03:27 Example. Interesting question. So our goal here is to develop a way to measure success of Airbnb. I'd love to understand if we're considering Airbnb holistically or a specific feature within Airbnb. 03:38 Then let's say Airbnb's search experience. Okay, great. And can I assume we're interested in measuring success of Airbnb across their apps and web experience? 03:46 Yep, you should think about both. Okay, next. Company and product context. Now that you've established them baselines, it's time to speak about the company and provide context for the product that you were focusing on. 03:58 Chat through. Why was the company created in the first place? What their goal is? Generally, what problem are they trying to solve for the core user? 04:05 Who are their competitors, the industry and the market they exist in? What is their strategy? How does this specific feature or product fit into the overall strategy? 04:15 After you're done, check in with the interviewer. One of this is ensuring you're speaking a common language and not making any assumptions that your interviewer disagrees with. 04:24 This section is helpful to wow your interviewer with your ability to understand and communicate overall context within the problem that you're trying to solve here. 04:32 So an example could be. Okay, great. So I think I'll first chat a little bit about Airbnb just to make sure we're aligned. 04:39 Then I'll dive into their users and speak to the user journey. After that I'll brainstorm some metrics and choose ones to focus on. 04:45 At the end I'm gonna go through any trade-offs or pitfalls with those metrics. Does that sound good? Sure, that sounds good. 04:51 Okay, great. So Airbnb is really interesting. They got started really as a way for people interested in traveling to find unique and cost-effective alternatives to hotels. 05:00 They've definitely increased in popularity over the years and now Airbnb's are a very top of mind for travelers looking for a place to say. 05:07 It's interesting because very recently we've almost seen people rebel against Airbnb due to their increasing cost. Their search experience is really critical because that's the moment where one of their users is deciding between an Airbnb or a hotel. 05:20 If the search experience is poor, users may end up Thanks for watching! Using a hotel alternative. Overall, Airbnb needs to continue to innovate and offer a great booking and stay experience to remain competitive in the overall market. 05:32 Okay, now that you've set the product and company context, text, you're going to find user segments. This section should be relatively quick. 05:39 And it's there to demonstrate to the interviewer that you're thinking about all the different types of users. It's important throughout PM interviewers interviews again to bring up users. 05:49 They should always be at the center of our work. You can segment out users in a similar fashion to the product design and sense interview. 05:54 So check out. That recording. But another way to segment would be the user types. It's not uncommon for a product to have multiple types. 06:01 For example, for example buyers and sellers, clients and providers, drivers and passengers, restaurants, couriers and customers. This is another way to break it down. 06:10 So an example. You can't believe it, you can't believe it, you can't believe it. Airbnb is unique in that it has two sides of its marketplace, guests and hosts. 06:16 The guests are the ones that are searching and booking places and experiences. The hosts are the people who are selling those places and experiences. 06:23 Both sides of Airbnb's marketplace are crucial to its success. If you don't have any hosts, Thanks for watching! Then guests won't be able to book anything and won't be able to search your book. 06:31 And if you don't have guests booking, hosts aren't going to receive any bookings and will go elsewhere to sell their products like their apartments. 06:38 As we think about how to measure success for Airbnb, it's crucial we consider both of these user types. I'll see you in the next clip. Okay, now that we've gone through the process of defining out our user segments, it's time to run through the user's journey. 06:51 You're going to want to chat through what a user is doing during their time on the product and this will end up being foundational to the metrics you brainstorm later. 06:57 Consider what was the external triggers Cheers. That actually caused them to jump on and start using your product that day. 07:03 What are the first things your user does on the product? What do they do to accomplish their goal? And what is the end point or happy path for all the users? 07:12 You can spend about 60 seconds brainstorming this user journey before presenting. Thank you for watching. It's the interviewer. So this is an example where you'd pause, you write down on the piece of paper in front of you the user journey and then you would speak to it to the interviewer. 07:23 So the example here. Fantastic. So now I'm going to walk through the user journey focusing primarily on the Airbnb search experience. 07:31 I'll be considering both the guests in house, hosts but since our focus is on the search experience the journey will be a bit more guest-centric. 07:40 First, the external trigger. A user may be prompted to use Airbnb search feature for a variety of reasons. They could have a planned vacation, a spontaneous weekend getaway or a business trip. 07:50 Seasonal promotions or email campaigns might also serve as triggers. In some cases it could even be word of mouth recommendations. 07:57 Once the user is triggered and lands on Airbnb whether it's via their web browser or a mobile app, the very first thing most users would do is input their search criteria. 08:07 This typically includes the destination, the check-in dates and check-out dates and the number of guests we're going. Advanced search filters for things like price range, property type, and amenities are also available but those may be coming up as secondary steps for users. 08:20 At KELOLAND news. Expected to be The day is now a few years of The weather is to accomplish their goal which is finding and booking a suitable accommodation users are going to scroll through the list of search results possibly fine-tuning their search criteria as they go they may also read reviews look 08:32 at pictures compare prices and once they find a place that meets their criteria. They will go through the booking process which involves confirming availability price and everything to drive towards eventually proceeding to the payment. 08:46 The end point or the happy path for the guest user will be successfully booking an accommodation that fits their criteria. 08:51 They would receive a comment. Information and they're feeling confident about their upcoming stay. So the search experience plays a critical role in this journey because if the search is cumbersome, slow, or non-intuitive, the user may abandon the process altogether and switch to a competitor, like 09:06 a hotel booking site. Similarly, if the search algorithm is not effective in matching users with the type of properties they're looking for, both guests and hosts lose out. 09:15 Guests don't find what they want and hosts don't get their properties booked. Okay, so now that I've gone through the entire journey of a user, and by the way, as I was going, I was demonstrating that I have a really strong user empathy I'm able to communicate all these things very clearly. 09:33 And this is all critical during this during this phase goal. Now that our users and user journey are defined, it's time to clearly articulate to you. 09:41 The goal of our team, what is success looked like for us? It'll essentially answer the original question that the interviewer has, but it won't include the actual metric and data points used to measure the success. 09:52 It simply paints a picture of the world in which our product is successful. To demonstrate the difference, like a goal is Airbnb's search goal is to ensure guests can find the best accommodations for them in book, whereas the metric would be searched to check out conversion rate. 10:06 Okay. So an example of the goal. Okay. So taking a step back, we've discussed Airbnb's place in the market. We've dove into their user segments of the market. 10:13 And now I want to define an overarching goal for the Airbnb search experience. And I believe that it is to help guests seamlessly find the best possible accommodations for them. 10:23 If we're successful, we will get guests booked and coming back for more the next time. Okay. Now, now that you've defined the goal, it's time to brainstorm metrics. 10:33 The metrics should directly tie to this goal that you've just stated and make sense in the context of the company and the business model overall. 10:40 Keep in mind while you brainstorm these metrics that you will want one of them to be your north star metric. 10:45 And that should always be one, one north star. And then you'll want one to three supporting metrics. These are additional things to track that support your north star. 10:54 And then one to two counter metrics. These are metrics to basically understand if there are any unintended side effects of the work that team may be doing. 11:03 So you can check out the common metrics that PM's track within this, this guide here. There's a ton of different ones. 11:09 So get familiar with these. And these are ones that you can bring up in your interview. So an example here for the metrics brainstorm. 11:15 Let's talk about the metrics that could best measure the success of Airbnb search experience based on the overarching goal to help guests seamlessly find the best possible accommodations. 11:26 We can broadly care categorize our metrics in the following user experience metrics conversion metrics and then retention metrics for user experience. 11:34 Sometimes we might consider the average load time to make sure the search experience is fast. It's well known that the slower an experience the lower the conversion. 11:41 When it comes to conversion booking conversion rate would be a top contender indicating how many searches actually lead to bookings. 11:48 Additionally click through rate or CTR on listings can provide insights into the effectiveness of our search results. Finally within the realm of retention return rate to search page can be a powerful indicator of how many guests had a good enough experience to come back and use the search functionality 12:05 again. This could be measured on a 30 day basis since guests typically search across several days. Then you're going to want to prioritize those metrics so now that you've chatted through and brainstormed some it's time to present the one that you will actually choose. 12:19 You will present again a one north star metric so this should be a to wrap up. If you have a correct measure of the ultimate success or goal of your product, one to two supporting metrics, the metrics should impact the north star metric but shouldn't independently equate the success of your product. 12:34 And then one or two counter metrics. These are in place to ensure that you aren't doing any harm. Remember, this will definitely answer the original question asked. 12:45 Make sure that however you deliver the answer here ties to the original question and clarify any details if applicable about how you would actually measure the metric. 12:54 If it wasn't clear. So here's an example of how we can prioritize the metrics based on our brainstorm. So to go back to your original question, how would we measure the success of Airbnb search? 13:06 I would propose that our north star metric be booking conversion rate. This is the most direct measure of whether the search experience is helping users find and book what they're looking for. 13:15 We'd measure this with a funnel starting with a user with a user starting a search on desktop or mobile and ending in checkout completion. 13:22 The higher the conversion rate, the better we are at being able to help guests find a combination that worked best for them. 13:29 For supporting metrics, I think I would suggest load time and then click the rate of listings. Load time is critical no because no matter how relevant the results are if they don't load quickly users may abandon the process. 13:40 And the click the rate can tell us how relevant the listings that are Thanks for watching! Are that appear in the search results. 13:45 These metrics would give us a more well-rounded view of the overall user's experience. And then finally countermetrics are important because they help us understand the trade-offs that we might be making. 13:55 In this case a good countermetric could be a return rate to search page. A higher I don't know. I don't know. A return rate could indicate that although users are converting they may not be fully satisfied with their booking and are returning to search again. 14:06 We could look into cancellation rate here as well. Another metric could be CSAT scores. If we were to run an A-B test that increased conversion but decreased CSAT, Thanks for watching! That could be cause for concern for our longer term growth. 14:18 We would ideally want to increase both of these. Finally, at the end, it would be worthwhile to chat through any trade-offs or pitfalls that you'd be making by choosing this specific metric as your North Star. 14:29 Again, trade-offs are giving up one benefit in order. In order to gain another that is more advantageous and a pitfall is a hidden or unexpected problem just advantage or challenge that comes with a particular course of action. 14:40 So, it's worth noting that no one metric is without flaws. Laws. It demonstrates to your interviewer that you're aware of this and actively can consider it. 14:48 So, an example running through trade-offs and pitfalls. You could say before we wrap up I'd like to discuss briefly some trade-offs and potential pitfalls associated with choosing conversion rate as our North Star metric. 14:59 Sure, go ahead. Well, firstly focusing too much on conversion rate could lead us to up optimize for short-term gains at the expense of long-term user satisfaction. 15:08 For instance, we might include more urgent messages like only two rooms left to increase immediate bookings. While this will probably boost conversion rates in the short term, it could also create a stressful user experience and diminish trust. 15:20 Then they could say that's a valid point. Secondly, a high conversion rate doesn't necessarily mean all user segments are well served. 15:27 For example, if our algorithm is optimized to show listings that are most likely to be booked, it might favor popular destinations and types of combinations. 15:35 This could potentially alienate users who are looking for something more unique or specific, thereby narrowing the range of successful host listings. 15:43 Interesting. So what could we do to mitigate that? They may have as a follow up. Well, we could use segment based conversion metrics to ensure that we're not just focusing on the average forward. 15:52 Conversion, but are considering various user groups. This would involve breaking down conversion rates by different segments like new versus returning or types of accommodations served for. 16:02 Lastly, a high conversion rate might necessarily mean high revenue or profitability. If we're only filling the cheapest listings, the business might suffer even if the number of book is in this high. 16:12 So it's essential to consider average revenue per user, or poo, and customer lifetime value alongside conversion rate. That makes a lot of sense. 16:21 So in conclusion, while conversion rate would be an and I'll see you in the next video. Thank you very much. Okay. So that is an overview of the first type of question, um, which is identifying KPIs. And now that brings us to the second type of analytics question that you may be asked within this interview 16:54 . And sometimes this happens all in the same interview. Other times the full interviewers . . Spoke is focused on one or this second aspect root cause analysis. 17:01 But I'm keeping it in the same lesson because they're very related. So in terms of root cause analysis, the goal for these types of questions is to demonstrate to your interviewer that you're able to effectively dive agnose an issue with your product in a structured way. 17:16 Interviewers want to see that you're able to make sense of data and ask the right questions. So one framework to follow is Tropic, Time Region, Other Features, Platform Industry, Competition and Cannibalization. 17:28 In terms of how to approach the problem, you're going to want to start with clarifying context questions. You're going to want to investigate with data. 17:34 You're going to loop through this list and other questions until you find the root cause. Then you're going to outline next steps and then summarize at the end. 17:42 So here's an example question that you may be asked. We'll see you in the next We'll see you in the next We'll see you in the next We'll see you in the next You're the PMF Netflix and the number of hours watched overall is 20% down this week. 17:50 What would you do about this? Okay, so the first thing that you're going to want to do here is ask these clarifying context questions. 17:58 You gotcha. So when we say there's a 20% decrease in overall hours watched, is this compared to the same week last year or is it dropped from just the previous week? 18:07 Them. It's a drop from the previous week. Okay, got it. And does this data represent a global decline or are specific regions more affected? 18:15 Them. It's an overall figure. Here. We'll see you next week. You haven't broken it down yet. Okay, so now you're gonna go into the phase of investigating the data and you're gonna loop until you find the root cause. 18:24 First one is time. Okay, let's get into this. So starting with the time aspect, were there any public holidays or major events in the last week that could potentially explain the is decline like sports events, concerts, any of that sort, not that we're aware of. 18:39 Alright, let's roll out seasonality or special events then. You moving on to the regional data, can we break down the 20% drop by region? 18:47 It's, it's really important to know if this is a We'll see you in the next one. On the next slide have you ever seen a scenario called global issue or localized to specific areas that actually North America and Europe are the most effective affected with a drop around 25% and 20% respectively. 19:00 Interesting have we noticed any localized server issues or could this be related to regional events? No server issues reported so far and no significant changes in regional content. 19:11 Okay. Well, were there any updates or feature changes made last week? Even small changes can have some unintended consequences. We did push an update but it was mostly back end stuff. 19:22 So as you're going through this, you're starting today. You're putting on your investigator or detective hat. You're trying to ask questions to understand the data better and learn about what could be the root cause. 19:34 So think of yourself as an investigator or a detective. And it might Bye bye. It's seen, you know, awkward or stressful because you're going from this ambiguous unknown problem and you're trying to identify the root cause. 19:45 But this is what a product manager does. They don't have, you know, they're presented with a problem. They don't have a ton of data and they're trying to work through it with their team. 19:53 They're asking the right questions. Okay. So, could you have a more detailed list? Or could we have a more detailed list of what those back and changes entailed? 20:02 Sometimes small tweaks can cast aid into user facing issues. I can get that information but it'll take some time. Okay. 20:09 Well, while we gather that let's consider the platform. Can you provide data on how the 20% drop breaks down by platform? 20:16 Mobile web browsers and smart TVs. Well the drop is primarily occurring on web browsers. Mobile and smart TV metrics are stable. 20:24 Interesting. That narrows it down. Any recent browser Thanks for watching! As we're updates that might interfere with our service, then not that we're aware of. 20:30 Well, okay, let's look at the industry context. Are there any competitors or even adjacent sectors like online gaming experiencing any similar issues? 20:39 No, everything else seems stable industry wide. Okay are there any new releases, special offers or anything noteworthy happening from our competitors that could have pulled our audience? 20:49 No, nothing significant this week. Okay, lastly, cannibalization. I mean, did we promote any other services or make changes that could have resulted in internal and we'll see you in the next competition like diverting users from their usual watching patterns? 21:03 No, no no services or features that would cause cannibalization. Alright, let's circle back on that back end change. Do we have the details yet? 21:11 Them. Yes, our engineering team found an issue affecting video stream start times on web browsers particularly affecting North America and Europe. 21:20 Okay, fantastic. We've identified the root cause. The slower video stream start time on web browsers is likely impacting user engagement. 21:28 And in given this, my recommendation for the next step would be. Keep. Number one, I think we should roll back the recent backend update affecting web browsers. 21:36 Parallel Lee, I think we should develop a hot fix to expedite the stream start time and validate its effectiveness with a smaller user segment. 21:45 Three, I'm going to coordinate with the support team. Is going to be a big big a big deal. This is the main team. The team has been to proactively address user concerns and inform them of this fix. 21:51 And then finally, I'm going to schedule a post mortem to review with the engineers why this issue wasn't identified earlier. 21:57 I'm going to include QA in that. And I'm going to try to figure out how we can prevent similar situations in the future. 22:02 Next week, we will be looking forward to the video. That sounds like a good approach. Yes, I think that covers it pretty comprehensively. 22:07 Okay, in summary, we've determined that the slower video stream start times on web browsers are likely causing the 20% drop in overall hours watched. 22:18 The problem in more significant in North America and Europe, immediate steps would be taken to roll back the offending update and apply a hot fix. 22:27 We'll also improve our monitoring mechanism to ensure early detection of similar issues going forward. So in this way, you're able to break down the overall vague and ambiguous question of, okay, 20, you know, the hours watched are down 20%. 22:41 Now we've gotten to a root cause. We've identified next steps and we've clearly summarized how we got to that point. 22:47 Okay, so next I wanted to go over different tips that I have for you to succeed. So the framework Tropic exists to help guide you in answering this question, but it is very possible that the real reason is not one of the sections within Tropic. 23:02 For example, it could end up being something like user segments or bugs or normal seasonality like every Thank you for watching. 23:12 You should act like a detective in this interview. Your ultimate goal is to identify the problem and propose next steps. 23:19 Dig in where you get certain piece of info and don't stop until you have a solid reason to explain the initial prompt. 23:26 Practice makes perfect with these types of questions so definitely try to run through several ones out loud to yourself, try to think through all these different ways to break down the data, all the types of follow up questions to ask and you know, definitely set up mock interviews for this one as well 23:42 . Alright, see you in the next one which is it'll be on product strategy. Thank you for",Learn how to answer analytics and execution interview questions by defining KPIs and running structured root-cause analyses so you can justify decisions and propose clear next steps.,adece8a1-85a3-4e55-b177-fd5655193630,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Analytics / Execution,18,TRUE,24,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:13.55432+00
95cc0d73f12f4fae832269d04501b581,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm gonna go over the product strategy PM interview. So in this interview, what are they actually testing for? 00:08 They're trying to identify your ability to define and drive forward a strategy for your product. In order to be effective in this type of interview, you should be able to understand, think through, and communicate the following things. 00:20 One, the broader business landscape a company is operating in. The goals of the business. What are they trying to achieve? 00:26 The monetization method of the business. How do they earn money? The threats to the business. What is threatening or Thanks for watching! At risk for their business to continue succeeding. 00:35 The levers the business can pull to grow. The growth strategy of the business. How do they continue to gain revenue over time? 00:42 And the unique value prop of the business. So here are some example questions that you could be asked in this type of interview. 00:48 Thank you. How would you increase Yelp's revenue by 5x in the next three years? How would you price a new subscription tier for Netflix? 00:56 Should Walmart start a streaming business? Should Uber Eats enter a new market in South Africa? Why did Amazon acquire Whole Foods? 01:04 So in order to effectively answer this type of question, you should consider the following framework. One, clarifying questions. Two, going into users. 01:13 Three, business model and mission. Four competitors. Five, supply versus demand. Six, entrance. Seven, landscape and then finally answer. So these are all the different types of things that may impact the company that are surrounding them. 01:27 These are all parts of a moving, a big moving machine. And you're gonna take time to break down all those parts and then ultimately deliver an answer to the question. 01:36 So, clarifying questions. As with all PM interviews, you should first start by asking clarifying questions to the interviewer. Understand the scope of the question. 01:46 If they're asking about revenue, understand if it's overall revenue or revenue for a specific product line. If they're asking about a new product line, ask questions to better understand the products being proposed. 01:57 If they're asking about a company or product that you're not familiar with, it's really important that you dig in for information that will help you answer the question later on, et cetera. 02:06 So come up with questions to clarify things for you and make sure you have the best foundation moving forward. Next, you're going to go into users. 02:14 You're going to want to clearly communicate the different users that the company has. Consider a bunch of different segments of users, different types of users, different locations, et cetera, in the context of the question you're asked. 02:25 You know, you know, it's a good thing, but it's an place to see that. It's you know, and then consider the pain points or the reason that they're using the product. So, for example, you could have YouTube. 02:31 Within YouTube, there's creators, viewers, advertisers, subscribers versus non-subscribers, et cetera. Within creators, there's hobbyists versus business. The goal is to make them grow a brand, et cetera. 02:43 Whereas you have viewers learning something new versus entertainment from boredom, et cetera. Within the company Google, you have business users versus consumer users. 02:52 Within Uber Eats, there's couriers, there's restaurants, and there's customers. The couriers, they might want to get a part-time way. They might be using Uber Eats to have a part-time way to make income. 03:02 Restaurants may be using it to get more customers. Netflix, you have a family plan versus a standard plan. So think about the users. 03:09 Think about all this and break things down for the company. Okay, next. What are their expenses? Really analyze the business. 03:30 And keep it focused on the question. For example, within YouTube, the main revenue sources from advertisers doing video advertisements, but they have a new revenue stream from YouTube premium, which they launched within the last several years. 03:43 There's revenue split with creators. And they have to be able to diversify and expand where ads play YouTube app on TVs as an example. 03:54 So next Uber Eats, the main revenue source is restaurant fees and order fees. So they need to pay each courier a percentage Thank you. 04:02 Of the order. So those are just the high level fundamentals of how they make money and what is their business model. 04:08 Next is competitors. So other products that are solving the same or a similar problem as the company or products that you're analyzing. 04:16 These are really important to touch on. We'll see you in the next one. Why is this? The reason is because even if the product you're analyzing now is doing well, existing competitors are ready to swoop in and steal away customers at any point in time. 04:31 Also, it creates different market dynamics. For example, Uber Eats, We'll see you next week. If there's only one, that's a big difference than there being four. 04:41 A couple more examples. Within YouTube, there's TikTok. TikTok has grown very quickly in the attention economy. It expanded into long-form content recently. 04:49 It's highly effective We'll be right back to you. We'll be right back to you. This is a back burner alternative for video uploads. 04:56 Netflix. Alternatives might be HBO Max, whereas there's very high quality content and they have lists A-list celebrities make movies on there. 05:05 YouTube, this is free for viewers. It's a much more diverse set of content, but it's still kind of solving the core problem of, you know, wanting to watch something on your computer or on your phone. 05:17 Next, supply versus demand considerations. Sometimes it's worthwhile to touch on this as supply increases. Demand decreases and as supply decreases demand increases. 05:27 This is applicable in a lot of modern-day products around marketplaces, search engines, e-commerce stuff like that. So think about this in the context of your product. 05:36 An example here is within Uber Eats. If restaurants join faster than customers, restaurants will feel as though Uber Eats isn't worth the fees and they should just use their existing solutions to get customers. 05:46 If customers join faster than restaurants, there won't be many options to choose from or restaurants will be slammed with orders and they're going to be very slow which hurts the customer experience. 05:55 We love you, too. But thanks for joining us. We'll see you next week. We have a beautiful or if customers join faster than couriers, then orders will be slow and not fulfilled. 05:59 There's so much happening within the realm of supply and demand in a business. Entrance. As companies scale, it becomes harder and harder for them to continue to innovate. 06:08 They're enormous machines with tens of thousands lines, our COVID-19 weekend. Let's get started. We're going to get a chance You of code doing a number of different things to change one thing in one place may affect dozens or hundreds of other places. 06:17 What does this mean and why does it matter? New products leveraging the latest tech can enter a market and quickly disrupt it. 06:24 A great and recent example is Chachi BT. This popped up and we became one of the most used search engines in the entire globe before Google could even blink. 06:32 Chachi BT poses a real threat to a search engine like Google. It's leveraging more intelligent technology and creates a better experience overall for the end user. 06:41 And Google probably, you know, I'll, Despite them having worked on this, you know, Chachi BT or OpenAI is able to come up relatively quick and reach a massive scale by leveraging new technology and being able to innovate faster. 06:56 Landscape. This section focuses on taking a high level view of the landscape that the product operates in. You can consider things and chat about things like government regulations, organizations, technology advancements, macroeconomic trends, or overall threats to the industry or product type. 07:11 A couple examples here, Tesla. Tesla has been able to get away with its version of autonomous driving. However, it's not perfect and it's resulted in crashes. 07:20 Will the government catch up and regulate it? Will they shut it down? You know, that's a big, that's a big thing within the world of AI and autonomous driving and within the broader landscape. 07:29 Within Uber, the prevalence of Ubers in cities cause serious traffic problems. Will cities decide to limit the number of rideshare cars allowed to operate? 07:38 This is a direct threat to Uber and it has to do with the overall landscape. Finally is the answer. So it's time for you to answer to be presented to the interviewer. 07:47 You should take every everything that you chatted about into account in your justification. Your answer should tie directly back to the original question asked. 07:55 So consider the users, the business model, the competitors, the landscape and more. Your goal is to demonstrate to the interviewer that you took a systematic look. 08:04 . At the problem at hand and you're able to take several different vectors into account while making a decision and present it all in a cohesive manner. 08:12 If they asked a yes or no question answer clearly with a yes or no and then why. If they asked you to propose a strategy propose a structured strategy. 08:20 If you have any questions, please don't forget to subscribe to our channel! If you have any questions, please feel free to subscribe to our channel. I'll see you in the next video! If they asked you about threats, present the threats in order of importance. So really think about the question that you 08:29 were asked which can be a number of different things and then make sure at the end you're actually directly answering it and you're not going down a rabbit hole and answering something completely different. Okay so now I'm going to run through an example. 08:38 With this question of how you could go through a product strategy question. So should Walmart start a streaming business? First, that's an interesting question. 08:46 Before diving in, let me clarify a couple things. When we say streaming business, are you talking about video streaming similar to Netflix? 08:52 Or could it also involve other forms of media like music or gaming? Oh, that's good. Let's assume we're talking about video streaming for movies and TV shows. 09:01 Great. Thanks for clarifying. And one more question. Are we considering this streaming service to be international or more focused on the US market? 09:08 That's it. Let's say initially focused on the US but with plans to expand internationally. Okay, understanding our target users is the foundation of any product strategy. 09:17 For a Walmart streaming service, the target user base would likely be Walmart's existing customers who range from low to middle income families. 09:25 Family. We should also consider new customer segments attracted by unique offerings that Walmart can bring to the table. Features like integration with Walmart's online shopping or unique pricing models can make the service appealing. 09:37 Walmart's core mission is to save people's money people money so that they can live better. The streaming service would need to align with this mission likely through competitive pricing and perhaps bundled services. 09:48 The business model could involve subscriptions add supported tiers for new releases. The streaming market is highly competitive. . . With established players like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney Plus. 09:59 The market also has several niche players catering to specific genres or demographics. Walmart would not only need to compete with content quality but also in the user experience and pricing front as well. 10:10 Now. So the demand in terms of supply obtaining content licenses or creating original content would be a significant undertaking. Walmart would need to invest substantially in its content library. 10:22 On the demand side, as we mentioned, Walmart's existing customer base would provide an initial audience. We'll see you next time. 10:27 We'll see you next time. But the demand would depend on the uniqueness and quality of the content actually offered. Okay, in terms of entrance. 10:34 If Walmart enters the streaming space, it's not just about competing with existing players, but it's also about pre-empting future competition. 10:43 For instance, other retail chains might consider entering the space as the lines between tech and traditional traditional businesses continue to blur. 10:51 The landscape is shifting rapidly with technological advancements and changes in consumer behavior. While streaming is growing right now, it's essential to consider Thanks for watching! 10:59 That the market saturation is a risk and emerging technologies like AR and VR could change the media consumption landscape altogether. 11:08 Okay, so now my answer. So should Walmart start a streaming business? Given the high competitive intensity, the significant investment requires required. 11:16 And the potential for market saturation, it seems risky. However, if Walmart can leverage its existing customer base and ecosystem to offer unique bundled services and competitive pricing aligned with its mission, I think it could carve out a niche. 11:31 Therefore, entering the stream streaming business could be a strategic move, but it would require meticulous planning, a lot of investment, and a long-term commitment to content and technology. 11:40 So the key to success would likely lie in differentiation, whether or not there's exclusive content, unique features, or integration with existing Walmart. 11:48 Walmart. If Walmart can pull off all those aspects while also preparing for future market shifts, then yes, there can be a compelling case for Walmart to enter the streaming business. 12:01 So to answer your question directly, I do think that this is a great thing. I do think Walmart should enter the streaming market if we are able to believe internally that we can differentiate in a major way. 12:12 But if not, I do not think it's worthwhile for us to pursue and we should definitely consider investing our resources into something else. 12:19 Okay, so with then that question and then answer, I went through a ton of different ways to break down the problem. 12:25 I evaluated the different types of competitors that exist. The market and the landscape overall. And then ultimately I brought it back to the original question at hand and proposed an answer to taking into account all those factors. 12:39 Alright, so within this one there is several things to take into account. And we're gonna run through the interview grading rubik pretty quickly here. 12:51 Competitor analysis. So, Are you able to demonstrate a deep understanding of the competitors, what their strategies are, and what their weak points are? 12:59 Within the market, can you provide a nuanced understanding of the overall trends customer needs and growth opportunities? Collaboration. Are you collaborating within your discussion? 13:08 Thank you. Bye. Bye. Business acumen, are you articulating a coherent long-term business strategy that aligns with the company's mission? Are you asking insightful questions? 13:17 Are you creating a roadmap with clear milestones aligned with the business objectives? Are you identifying trade-offs or potential errors offering well-reviewed solutions and alternatives? 13:27 Are you passionate about your answer and you're offering innovative solutions or approaches? And then finally, are you doing all this in a really clear and articulate way? 13:36 Are you backing things up with rationale? Okay, so, you know, the interview may not be evaluating you on every single one of these skills, but likely one or more of these skills will be on their rubric for this type of interview. 13:49 So I hope that helps you understand the product strategy. In the next lesson, we're going to be going over the take home and the case study type of interview. 13:57 . Interview within the PM interview loop. See you there. Thanks for","Learn how to structure product strategy PM interview answers using a clear framework so you can deliver a justified, business-grounded recommendation that directly addresses the prompt.",d706de4d-9c8c-485f-8693-192fae09b3c7,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Product Strategy,19,TRUE,15,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:14.006165+00
e6e2e9e890ba4a22abb44017f1c4414d,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm gonna go over all the different types of product management interviews that you might come across when you're interviewing at a tech company It's important to note that not every company is the same In fact, every company does things slightly different But this will give you an overview 00:15 of all the different types of components that could be, uh, put into an interview loop at one of these companies So, it all starts out with the screening phase of the interview process You can think of this as a funnel where at the top you have all the candidates that are passing through the resume round 00:33 and they're getting into the funnel of actual interviews. Ultimately, at the end you're gonna end with an offer. So at each stage there's gonna be less and less people getting through. 00:42 So at this first stage you have typically a 20 to 30 minute phone call with a recruiter. They're gonna be just trying to disqualify candidates who clearly are not a good fit for the role. 00:54 So they're gonna ask a bit more about your experience. They're looking for different things that the hiring manager has told them to look for. 01:01 So this is all about volume, that the recruiters trying to get through a number of different candidates that have passed through the resume process and making sure that only a portion of them make their way to then the weed out stage and final stage as well. 01:16 Because one thing to note is that the product management people on the hiring loop are really, really busy, whether you're a hiring manager or just a PM or another role like an engineer who's in this interview loop, you can't be doing interviews all day every day. 01:32 So they wanna make sure that we're only passing through candidates that actually have a chance at being an effective PM in the company. 01:39 The other thing that they're doing here is they're trying to make sure that you didn't lie on your resume and that your experience actually is what is being displayed and conveyed through your resume. 01:50 So they're gonna ask kind of basic experiential type questions to really see, Do you have the skills to be an effective product manager? 01:58 Did you lie in your resume or are you a potentially a good fit for this role? So if you make it through to the next round, this is what I call as the weed out stage. 02:08 So this is typically like a 30 to 60 minute video call now with either a product manager on the team or the hiring manager at themselves. 02:17 And these are typically going to be much more deeper behavioral type questions. They're going to want to learn more about your experience, the impact that you drove in your previous roles, whether your previous roles were product management or a different type of role. 02:33 They're going to make, like, they're going to try to figure out, do you have the skillset to be a product manager at their company? 02:39 And in these interviews, you know, you cannot lie. You can't fluff your answers because these are product managers. They're seeing your PMs, their directors of product, they know what is real and what is not just based on their experience. 02:53 So they're getting to the real meat of your experience and they're digging deeper to see, could you really be an effective PM? 03:01 And after this round, they might have you then complete some type of take home assignment to see, okay, you know, you were good at talking about your past experiences, but you could have practiced really well. 03:12 But can you actually take a new problem and solve it in a short amount of time like one or two days send that back to us To show that you can actually apply your skills as a pm So they might give that to you and if you make it through this kind of weed out round Then you're making it to the final round 03:29 and you might be wondering why is there so much You know of this effort to see if the pm has an effective skill set or not and the reason is because the final round is is typically a lot of interviews. 03:41 It could be three to seven interviews across multiple days with various members of the team. So think about this, there's maybe seven hours or potentially more of time being spent by the company, by their employees, to interview just one candidate. 03:58 And oftentimes they're evaluating multiple candidates in that fine around. So that really adds up. So they wanna make sure that if you're getting to the fine around, you're a really serious candidate. 04:08 that you really have the possibility to come into this role and be effective. So if you then make it through the final round, that's when you would get an offer to join the team as a product manager. 04:20 So let's now go through the final round components. This is, again, the three to seven interviews that could last many hours across one or two days. 04:30 So the first type is behavioral. This is testing your ability to be an effective product manager on the team. Next is product design or product sense. 04:39 This is testing your ability to build products in a structured and really great way from a user experience standpoint. Next is product strategy, so we're testing the ability for you to think strategically about a product or a company's positioning. 04:55 Next is technical. This is testing your ability to work effectively with technical stakeholders like the engineers on the team. analytics, testing your ability to leverage data and decision making, execution, testing your ability to perform a root cause analysis on an issue that might be impacting the 05:12 platform. Estimation. This test your ability to estimate something by breaking it down into smaller components. Cross Functional. This is a gut check with your main stakeholders, whether that's a business stakeholder or engineering or anyone like that. 05:27 So again, I wanted to note that every company does things differently. You should expect slight or major variations between this list, depending on the companies that you're applying to. 05:37 For example, estimation interviews are not frequently given, but it could come up in your interview process, whereas product design, product sense is almost always asked in any product management interview that you might be coming across. 05:50 So now I wanted to dive into each of these a little bit more to give you example questions and explain a bit more about them. 05:57 So, starting with behavioral questions, these are really trying to reference your past experiences or situations that you've been in as either a product manager or a different neighbor role. 06:08 So, a couple of questions. I saw your resume, but would love to hear your story. Or, tell me about a time you had to convince someone of something. 06:16 Tell me about a time you had a conflict with an engineer on your team. What was the conflict? How did you work through that? 06:22 Stuff like that. What are your biggest weaknesses? They're really trying to understand your background, how you work with other people, your leadership style, and stuff like that. 06:31 Next is the product design or product sense interview. These types of questions can apply to any product or company. They sometimes are about the company that you're actually applying to, but other times they're about a random company, but they'll always be some type of popular, well-known company, like 06:48 Airbnb or YouTube, Netflix, LinkedIn, and stuff like that. So some example questions. Imagine you're a PM at Airbnb, your goal is to improve Airbnb, or design a product to encourage getting vaccinated, or how would you design a food ordering system for someone who is blind. 07:06 These are going to be kind of out of the box thinking at a really large scale, so they're going to be creative in nature and you're going to want to follow a specific process to get to an ultimate recommendation. 07:17 Next up is product strategy, so these types of questions can be again about any product or company, sometimes again it's the company you're applying to, but oftentimes it's going to be a different company but well-known. 07:29 So some examples. Should Airbnb start offering hotel rooms, or why did Amazon start a pharmacy? Or how would you increase Yelp's revenue by 5X? 07:39 Or should Rezzi get into the live events ticketing industry? These are more strategic in nature forcing you to think about the business and market dynamics and stuff like that. 07:48 Next is technical. So, these questions are typically about the software development process and our behavioral and nature, but sometimes if the role is very specific, technically specific, they might test your technical knowledge or have you do some type of technical case study. 08:06 So, some example questions. Can you share the difference between HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, or how would you collaborate with an engineer on a new feature implementation. 08:17 Describe a backend and a front end to a five-year-old, design an algorithm to rank doctors in a two-sided marketplace, like Zock-Dock, for example, or define the data models to support a SaaS billing system. 08:30 These are a different range of questions from the more behavioral ones, like number two, to a more technical case study, like four or five. 08:39 Next up is analytics. So these types of questions are testing your understanding of data and your ability to make strategic and smart decisions based on it. 08:48 So you could be asked, your PM for Amazon's checkout page, what metrics would you track? Or what's the ideal number of search results to display on Airbnb's marketplace? 08:58 How would you determine if TikTok's STEM feature is successful? Or your PM at LinkedIn? How would you decide whether or not to remove the profile step from the onboarding process? 09:09 Or finally, you just launched a new settings page at Spotify. How do you know if it's successful or not? So they're really trying to see, do you understand data? 09:18 How to track it? How to measure things and how to determine if your feature is successful or not? Next is execution. 09:25 So these are testing your ability to diagnose an issue with your product that you might be responsible for. So how do you investigate? 09:33 What is your process? Can you actually determine a root cause and then propose a solution? This is really a real world type thing where when you're a PM in these roles, there's to be problems that come up daily, weekly, or monthly, and you're going to have to be the one that's trying to figure out what 09:48 happened and come up with a solution. So for example, YouTube, daily views are down 20% this week compared to last or European at Airbnb. 09:57 And you notice that bookings are down this month. What would you do? Or LinkedIn connection requests are down 10%. What steps would you take to investigate and address this client? 10:08 Next is estimation. So these are really testing your ability to break down these like big complex questions into bite size components in a structured and logical manner so that you can actually make a decision on that information. 10:21 So examples estimate YouTube's monthly revenue or how many grocery stores are required in a city or estimate the number of Uber drivers required in New York City to ensure an average two minute pickup time. 10:33 These questions might immediately stump you but that's kind of the point. they want to see if you're able to come up with a strategy and a method to break this down into different pieces so you can ultimately estimate the answer and come up with a sensible answer. 10:49 Next, cross-functional. So these types of questions are testing your ability to work with other stakeholders on cross-functional teams, whether it's a business team, marketing, legal, sales, customer support, stuff like that. 11:02 So can you share a time you collaborated with a stakeholder folder on a project, or what's your philosophy around involving stakeholders in the product development process? 11:11 How do you prioritize tasks when working with a cross-functional team? And can you share an example of a time you have to say no to a stakeholder? 11:18 So hopefully this helped you give, again, an initial understanding of all the different types of interview questions and interview types that you're going to come across in these PM interviews. 11:28 In the following modules, you will learn a lot more about these interviews, learn frameworks so that you can answer them effectively and also see example answers so that you can easily learn what is a great answer and what might you want to stay away from in these interview questions. 11:45 So hope this helps and I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to identify the common stages and question types in product management interviews so you can prepare targeted responses for each part of the interview loop.,35e463ee-26ae-40f7-866f-9107218ff868,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Types of PM Interview Questions,2,TRUE,12,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:14.517055+00
4de347482feb477fa4e6eb9757c1e3bc,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to be going over the take home or case study assignment part of the PM interview loop. 00:07 So the goal of take home assignments when a company asks you to do this, they are assessing several different abilities that you may have. 00:14 Number one is user empathy. So your ability to do this, you're going to be able to do this, you're going to be able to identify customer pain points, market opportunities, and those will direct product development. 00:22 Two, solutioning. They want to see if you're able to understand user experience and UI principles and how they affect user satisfaction and retention. 00:30 Three, technical acumen. These are all going to help in realistic feature planning. Four, communication. Your ability to articulate and convey these complex ideas effectively, which is really important for stakeholder communication. 00:48 Creativity. Are you able to demonstrate genuine enthusiasm for the product and role through your take home assignment? Are you offering creative and out of the box solutions? 00:57 Do you have evident passion for problem solving? And then finally, your ability to prioritize your skill and discerning what must be done now. 01:08 So there's a couple different types of take home assignments. And these are the broad categories. It requires understanding of existing user feedback, analytics, and product strategy. 01:25 Number two, you could be asked to create a strategy for a product. So this assesses your ability to develop a plan for either launching a new product or improving on an existing one, but it's coming up with that strategy around it. 01:37 It requires understanding of the market, customer needs, and resources as well. The next, again, launch a new product. This is where you're asked to launch a new search feature or whatever on a product. 01:48 It evaluates your capacity and ability to identify needs, innovate, and strategize. And as well as feature prioritization. And answering your question, should a specific company launch a specific type of product? 02:02 This evaluates your analytical and decision-making skills. It requires a deep understanding of the market landscape, overall competitive environment, and the business objectives of that company to make a well-reasoned recommendation. 02:14 So the general framework that I recommend people take for these take-home assignments is as follows. And you can basically kind of pick and choose which one of these are most important. 02:25 You definitely don't always need to include every single one, but to be super comprehensive. This is the overarching framework that you should start kind of build off of. 02:35 I just want to just show you and tell you that this this framework overall is used. Just within the case studies portion of the product portfolio pro module. 02:45 So definitely check that out because the case studies that you're going to be doing and putting on your portfolio follow this same framework. 02:51 So number one is context summary and background to going through a hypothesis or an insight in the prompt. Three, the market and summarizing all the landscape there, then diving into user segments and different insights, documenting the user journey and pain points across that journey, coming up 03:08 with a goal and hypothesis and revisiting that hypothesis. Then. Feature ideation coming up with different features prioritizing those features choosing one and then picking it and launching and outlining a go to market plan outlining the metrics that you would use to track and 03:26 measure success of the feature that you chose. And then finally, we're going to talk a little bit about, what are the risks, mitigations, and pitfalls. Um, so next up is, um, diving into each one of these and going through an example question for them. 03:41 So an example question when within the theme of launching a new product you work for a well-reasonably. So, the clear goals, what are you aiming to achieve? 03:55 Who are your target users? Features, what features align with the objective? Metrics for success, how you measure your product success. 04:03 User demographics, understand the unique aspects of your target market. Your target market here is going to be people who are in need of monitoring their heart health. 04:11 Trade-offs and risks, are there any drawbacks or challenges in your proposal? So these are the types of sections and things to keep in mind when answering this question. 04:18 Common mistakes to avoid within this type of question. Vagueness, so a lack of specificity in goals and target audience. Ignoring metrics, so really failing to identify or measure the different KPIs that are associated with this. 04:34 Paying little attention to the actual user experience. Neglecting risks, so not accounting for potential setbacks, especially for this example question that has to do with healthcare. 04:46 Neglecting risks and calling them out is a really big mistake. You're the PM for a dating app, and your task is to improve user engagement. 04:57 Let's dive into the different components of it. Within a product vision perspective, what is the overarching goal for the product? 05:03 Who are we aiming to better serve? What updates will boost user engagement? Who are our competitors and how can we differentiate? 05:11 And then finally, how are we going to track and measure success to indicate an improvement? Common mistakes to avoid with this type of question. 05:18 Undefined goals. So not having a clear vision for what improvement actually means. You're going to want to get specific with that. 05:24 Poor research. So you're going to ignore user research and market trends. You're not really going to take into account what is the latest when it comes to dating apps. 05:31 Feature creep. You might add features that don't align with the product's core mission. You might stray too far away from the core aspect of a dating app. 05:39 And people, you know, the interviewer is going to think that you don't really have a strong grasp of what really makes sense to build within the product, that product intuition. 05:51 And finally, ignoring metrics, not setting or reviewing KPIs for your changes. Next, creating a strategy for a product. So you are the PM for a new sustainable package initiative. 06:02 Create a strategy for its rollout. Think about things like user needs. So who's in a benefit from this sustainable packaging? 06:09 What problems are we solving with it? What is the existing landscape of sustainable packaging? Who has started to adopt this? 06:15 I know Apple is really into this right now. Product features. What features or technologies make this initiative unique? What resourcing would we need to accomplish this? 06:24 Who would be involved? And then what channels and partnerships we can leverage to facilitate a successful launch? And then some mistakes to avoid. 06:32 So lack of depth. Ensuring thorough research and planning is going to be important. Ignoring trade-offs. You might not recognize the environmental versus cost balance. 06:41 So you might propose a solution but it ends up costing so much money and you ignored that. Undefined metrics. To counteract this, you want to establish clear KPIs for sustainability and profitability. 06:52 How are we actually going to measure it? So you're going to have to do research to understand industry standards when it comes to measuring the success of sustainable power. 06:59 And then poor structure. Keeping the strategy organized for better comprehension is a way to counteract this. And then finally, should a specific type of company launch a specific type of product? 07:12 So for example, should Apple expand it to making electric cars? So in this, it's more of a product strategy question that's asked in the form of a take-home assignment. 07:21 So you're going to want to do market research. Is there consumer demand for electric cars? A SWOT analysis. What are our advantages and challenges in entering this market? 07:29 Financial projections. Like what do we expect? Development and operational costs to be compared to how much we can sell it for. 07:36 How does it align with our brand or core competencies? And then overall, based on the data, what is the recommendation that I would be making? 07:44 So these are the types of unique aspects of this take-home that I could include. Common mistakes to avoid here. What does the electric cars market look like? 08:06 What does Apple look like? How would this help them? How would this hurt them? Ignoring risks, so identifying potential market or operational risks, and then proposing mitigations to those risks. 08:17 And then finally, unclear reasoning. To counteract this, make sure that you have very clear and reasoned arguments throughout the presentation. 08:25 So the answer format can can take a couple different formats but typically candidates will send back take-home assignments in two formats, a Google Doc or a presentation. 08:35 Usually companies are not going to expand a preference towards either of these and they're both acceptable and you should choose what fits the prompt, well, and what you excel at. 08:43 Regardless of the format, you should keep in mind the following. Content is number one and format and styling is number two. 08:50 Always stay on topic, don't go off on the list. Information is possible, you want to make sure that it's clear and concise and you're not rambling in any of the sections. 09:00 Don't focus too much on a single aspect of the assignment and then not develop the other areas equally. For example, if you spend too much time on the solution and not on the problem definition your solutions may completely be off the mark. 09:12 Next communicate cohesively so make sure that as you're going through this presentation it follows a a you know story arc and you're communicating all the different points cohesively and they should app to each other and relate to one another. 09:27 Definitely avoid spelling and grammar mistakes. This is definitely a way to take points away for your score and then overall keep it professional in nature. 09:36 Think of it as a business document that you would ultimately be sending to your boss in your current job. So, remember, be structured, comprehensive, and succinct. 09:45 When in doubt, ask me for help gaining clarity here. So next, I'm going to go over the grading rubric for this type of interview. 09:53 And so it comes down to writing and presentation skills. Written and presentation material is clear, well organized, and persuasive. You're being creative, offering out of the box, innovative solutions. 10:05 You prioritize well based on impact and feasibility. You have strong design sense and you propose aesthetically pleasing. And functional, superior solutions. 10:16 Your technical knowledge is strong, so it demonstrates a deep understanding of technology, applies technical insights effectively within the case. Analytics, so you're mentioning metrics. 10:27 You excel in data interpretation. User empathy, you demonstrate deep understanding of the user needs and pain points for the target user. 10:35 And then finally, market research. You're able to provide comprehensive and insightful market analysis. You identify trends, opportunities, and risks effectively within it. 10:45 This is the take home lesson. In the next one, I'm going to go over different questions that you should ask within your interviews. 10:51 See you there.","Learn how to structure and deliver a PM take-home case study using a clear framework so you can produce a compelling, well-scored interview submission.",16f30fd1-170f-4f1c-8b7c-298e7a735750,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Take Home / Case Study,20,TRUE,11,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:19.007033+00
ec0715d430b14c66946067321ec2555f,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over what PM interviewers are actually looking for in the candidates. So, the first question here is, what is the goal of an interviewing team? 00:09 And the answer, simply put, is that they're looking for the absolute best person for the team that has an opening. 00:15 This might be obvious, but what does that really mean? To them, the absolute best person is the least risky candidate. 00:22 Hiring a bad PM could be, very detrimental to the team and the company, because the PM is the person who is actually deciding what are all these engineers going to work on. 00:32 And if you think about an engineer, an engineer might be making $200,000. So, if there's even five engineers on the team, that's a million dollars that the company is spending on this team in a given year, let alone the product manager, the analysts, the designers. 00:48 Etc. And the PM is responsible for all the work that this team is doing. So, hiring a bad PM is very, very risky, just purely from a monetary perspective. 00:59 But secondly, a PM could make bad decisions and choices and lead the product in the wrong direction, which ultimately hurts the company's growth, their retention, stuff like that. 01:10 So their goal is to find a kid. And it who is, poses like zero risk, no risk to the company, to the teams, stuff like that. 01:19 So the farther along that you get in the interview process, the less risky you become to the company. They're learning more about you. They're learning your style. 01:27 They're learning about your experience. They're learning about your ability to solve a problem in a creative way or in a short amount of time. 01:35 You can think of this. Very similarly to becoming official with your partner or exclusive. Like, would you ask them to become official after the first date? 01:44 No, the third date, probably not. Um, you're going to need to get to know your partner on a very deep level before you move to that next stage. 01:51 And interviewing is very similar. They're going to try to really understand you really understand. Are you going to be effective in this role? 01:59 Do you bring along any risks? any red flags that should be considered in the way that you're thinking or communicating, working together? 02:07 Um, they're, they're looking for all these different types of things to go back to, um, again, the potential downstream effects of hiring a bad candidate versus hiring a good candidate. 02:19 So how do they determine who is actually the best person for the role? So the way that they do this is, is by using a standardized set of questions and rubrics within their company to evaluate the candidates. 02:33 So they'll calibrate after interviewing several candidates and then stack rank all of them based on their performance. The grading rubrics ensure that interviewers are really fairly and consistently evaluating several different candidates against one another. 02:45 And in another lesson, we're going to go over these grading rubrics in more detail. But the idea here is if you ask different questions to different candidates, there's no way to really compare them against one another. 02:56 So you have to ask the same questions to all the interviewers, have the same grading rubrics so that you can be really consistent about it. 03:04 So how do you show that you are the best person for the role and really perform well in these interviews? 03:09 So try to get into the mindset of an interviewer. Understand where they're coming from and how they're supposed to evaluate you. 03:17 So really pay attention to the group grading rubric lesson because this is going to help you to reverse engineer your interviewing answers to really fit into what they're expecting and what they want to hear. 03:30 So I want you to remember that you could be a very intelligent person and you could be a great fit for the role. 03:36 Your background could be But an interviewer is only meeting you for literally 30 to 60 minutes and they have to make a determination in that amount of time if you are good for their company and good for their team. 03:50 So that, so that means that you need to work extra hard in this short amount of time to prove that you have the ability to be an effective leader. 03:59 where you can delete. deliver these interview answers in a powerful and great way, uhm, and this is really a different skill set than actually being good at the job of a product manager. 04:11 This is about interviewing. I've known a lot of very, very strong product managers who actually have so much trouble in interviewers or in interviews because they don't practice the skill of interviewing. 04:24 Again, this is very different than the role of a product manager because you're, you're trying to convey all these different skills in a short amount of time versus product management, which, you know, you have 40 hours in a week to think through these and work with your team, work with different stakeholders 04:43 . In an interview, you're trying to do all those types of functions in a short amount of time, communicate them well. 04:49 So, this is a real skill that one can practice and a lot of people don't end up practicing and then they end up not doing super well, despite being a really strong candidate. 05:00 So I want to go over some skills for you to consider. Within each of the interview types, there's different things that they're going to be looking for, um, between behavioral versus analytical product design to distinguish a strong candidate versus a weak candidate, but outside of that, there are these 05:16 kind of overarching skills that candidates should focus on to score highly throughout all the different interviews, uh, to increase their chances at an offer. 05:25 So, I'm going to go into each one of these, uh, in a sec, but things like structured thinking, analytics, listening adaptability, stuff like that. 05:33 So, the first one here is structured thinking and communication. Interviewers want to know that if they hire you, you are going to be an effective and clear communicator with different stakeholders in the company. 05:45 Communication is absolutely vital in the role of product management because your words have a lot of power. What you say results in decisions that are getting made in the product, rollout plans, go to market plans, you know, what you say makes that happen. 06:01 That difference between a good rollout and a bad rollout or a feature being developed in the right way or the wrong way. 06:07 So they want to know can you communicate things really clearly and effectively instruction in a structured manner so that whoever you're talking to, whether it's an engineer, a designer, a lawyer, an analyst like they all can understand you. 06:20 They know what you're you're talking about and they can take action based on your guidance. So one way that you can prove this in an interview setting is giving very clear and structured answers. 06:32 So an example, you could say, sure, there are three main reasons why I'm interested in joining Airbnb specifically. Number one, I'm excited about XYZ. 06:42 Number two, I believe XYZ, etc. This format is really easy. For an interviewer to follow, it's very structured. You're literally going in methodical order. 06:54 And when you talk without structure, they're going to have trouble following you. And they're going to remember you as a very unclear and chaotic interviewer and communicator as well. 07:06 The next piece is analytics. Interviewers are always assessing your analytical skills. This is very, very critical. Critical to emphasize in your interviews, because data is an enormous part of being a product manager. 07:20 PMs need to be able to understand data, how to actually track things, how to gather insights from data, and how to make decisions, smart decisions based on data. 07:30 One way to communicate that you have this skill, you are strong with analytics, is to incorporate data, analytics, and metrics. 07:37 into all of your different interview, uh, interview answers, as you're going through these, these interviews. So, some examples here. You could say at the end of an interview, answer, So, yeah, ultimately, we were able to decrease our customer complaints by 15% after implementing that solution. 07:53 This is very short and sweet, but it shows the interviewer, like, you're thinking about metrics, ultimately, you are data-driven, you're, you're strong with driving towards metric-based outcomes. 08:03 You're not just working on projects just for the sake of working on them. You could say our North Star metric for the project was churn rate. 08:11 Our goal was to reduce it by 5%. This is very clear and straightforward, saying, what is your goal? What, how are you going to measure this? 08:19 And, and what is your target? Then you could say, just because we were able to build this feature, this doesn't mean that is impactful. 08:25 When looking into the metrics we saw XYZ, this is showing that you're not just building things, as I said, to build things, but you're actually trying to drive outcomes, which is critical in the role of a product manager. 08:38 Next is listening. A big part of the PM role is listening to others, ingesting that information, and then formulating a response or some guidance. 08:47 In other words, you need to be good at taking risks. Taking what someone is saying and breaking it down into the necessary components to really understand the context. 08:55 So to communicate your ability to listen in interviews, you want to make sure that you're really deeply paying attention to what they're actually asking you. 09:03 You could write down notes as they're asking questions, either on your computer or in front of you, so that you can then reference it later on in the interview. 09:11 You want to ask follow-up questions, or if clarifying questions, if you're having trouble understanding something, never, never just move forward with an interview question if you really don't get it or don't understand what they're asking. 09:24 So some examples here. Um, what I'm hearing is you're interested in learning about a time I did XYZ. Just to clarify that, does that, you know, sound right to you? 09:34 Next is adaptability. Product managers have to adapt in this in their roles based on new information that is being brought to light, especially in a small company like a startup, a seed stage startup, or, uh, you know, a series a startup, there's a lot of change that's going to happen on a day to day 09:50 basis or even hour to hour basis. So they want to know, can you adapt, um, in any given situation, whether it's something being thrown at you in a day or just something changing about the product. 10:02 Product or the market or your users that you have to adapt to when it comes to your interviews. The interviewers might throw you some type of curve ball to try to evaluate your adaptability. 10:13 They might change the prompt halfway through the interview, um, or change an assumption that you have made or that they told you. 10:20 So try to make sure that this doesn't throw you off there. They're doing this on purpose. as they're testing your ability. 10:26 To adapt your answer and and really come up with an alternate way of solving it. So some examples here, you might say, okay, so our original plan was to increase the conversion rate, but based on this recent piece of information, it seems like it might be more beneficial for us to focus on decreasing 10:45 churn. So with that new goal in mind, I would do this and then you can go on from there. The next is stakeholder management. 10:52 A huge part of being a PM is working with and managing different stakeholders. So those can be people on the sales team, customer support, business units, um, marketing, growth teams, legal teams, et cetera. 11:05 You want to make sure to emphasize that your goal is always to ensure that the team is positively impacting the organization. 11:12 And that means that you will likely not. Not always be able to appease everyone. So communicate that through your answers. 11:19 You want to communicate that you're valuing the opinion of all of your stakeholders. You will take their asks into consideration and weigh everything against each other. 11:28 Um, but ultimately you're going to come up with solutions and pass forward that ensure success for the company as a whole, not to ensure success for one specific individual or department. 11:38 You, you have to think about the company as a whole, because a lot of people are going to ask you for different things as a PM. 11:44 Next is technical acumen. While PMs don't need to know how to code or be very involved in specific aspects of the engineering process, they do need to understand technology at a high level so that they can communicate with the engineers. 11:58 You want to ensure that you're able to speak intelligently about technical acumen. When in doubt, say that you would defer to your tech lead or the engineers on your team to answer engineering questions that you aren't sure of. 12:11 Because you never want to, you know, come up with something on the spot that is going to be clearly wrong. 12:16 You always want to say, you know, I don't actually, uhm, know that information, but I would defer to my engineering partners on the team. 12:23 Also, keep in mind a couple things. And these are just basic things. Baseline, uhm, pieces of information so that you can, you can answer effectively in the interview. 12:31 So, copy updates, uhm, like a, a label, what wording is on a label, small design tweaks, like moving a button around or changing the color of something, this should take very little time, like hours or days at most. 12:44 Data model updates or system updates, these should take more engineering time, so days to weeks. And then new feature build-outs, refactors, or stuff like that, that's going to take a lot of engineering time, so think weeks to months. 12:57 So, this should help you try to understand, just like, uhm, at a baseline, what could be considered a small engineering lift versus a very large engineering lift. 13:06 The next is user-centricity. At the end of the day, you're a product manager, and you're hired to solve problems for a specific type of user. 13:14 You have to keep in mind that users are at the center of your world. And you want to convey that users are at the center of your world by referencing them in everything that you're doing and saying. 13:29 So, think about questions like, who are the users? How does something you're talking about impact the users? What happens to the users if you do or don't do something? 13:38 What problems do the users have? Why are those problems particularly painful for them? Stuff like that. In interview answers, always try to tie your answers back to the user at hand. 13:51 This will really ensure that interviewers know that you care deeply about them, you care about solving problems for them, and you're keeping their best interests in mind in your decision-making process. 14:01 So, make sure to be careful. Be clear on how something will affect all user types as well. So, think about a company like Uber. 14:09 Uber has multiple different, uh, user types. They have the passengers, and they have the drivers. Or Uber Eats, who has the restaurants, the couriers, and then the eaters, you could say. 14:20 So, make sure to always reference the different types of users out there. Next is learning. P.M.s need to be at the cutting edge of technology and product development. 14:32 You want to emphasize in your answers that you love learning. You love staying up-to-date with the latest advancements as well. 14:36 So, in terms of technology, like, P.M.s should stay up-to-date with different advancements in the industry that could then be leveraged in their products. 14:44 Like, artificial intelligence is the biggest one lately. P.M.s should stay up-to-date with competitors as well. Who is doing what? What is new? 14:52 What is old, uhm, amongst your competitors? In terms of product development, like, what are the best ways to build products nowadays? 14:58 Should we integrate AI into our product development process? How has that changed over time? Uhm, what is trending and, and what is phasing out as well? 15:07 What rituals should you perform with your teams? Should you do pre-mortems instead of just doing post-mortems? So, really being curious about all this type of stuff, researching it, looking into it, so you can have an opinion on it in these interviews. 15:19 The last here is ethics. Companies want to hire PMs that are going to adhere to a strict set of ethical standards. 15:27 You should avoid talking about any type of dark pattern or deceitful product practices, like tricking users into making money, because this is just going to really raise red flags with the interviewers and you want to avoid that. 15:39 This at all costs, um, an example, you could say one of the goals of the project was ensuring that we were doing right bar by our users, because many of our competitors actually trick users with this specific type of feature. 15:51 So we wanted to make sure we were not manipulating them in any way. So with that in mind, we did X, Y, Z. 15:58 All right, so thank you for listening to this lesson. Hopefully this gives you a good overview. Of what PM interviewers are actually looking for and how you can talk, you know, show the interviewers in all these, um, questions and answers that you have the skills they're looking for. 16:14 You're not risky and you're going to be an effective and great hire for their team. All right, I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to align your PM interview answers to what interviewers evaluate—risk reduction and core competencies—so you can score higher and improve your chances of an offer.,ea2d4a13-4948-4aa3-86c2-adeed9fd4beb,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,What are PM interviewers looking for?,3,TRUE,17,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:19.411025+00
d76401b01b66419da3d0253f8e14d5b8,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over the grading rubrics that PM interviewers are using to evaluate your performance. So, typically, most rubrics will follow this format. So, there will be a skills section, there's going to be multiple skills per interview, and they're going to give you a rating. 0:18 So, a 1 to 4. So, 4 would mean very strong, where you, the candidate, demonstrated exceptional experience. A 3 would mean you had strong performance. 0:28 You demonstrated decent experience with this skill, but it didn't rise to the level of exceptional experience. 2 would mean you have subpar experience with this skill. 0:38 And 1, very weak, would mean that you demonstrated a complete lack of this skill. So, it's really that full spectrum of 1 to 4. Sometimes, the interviewers will give you a 3. 3.5, or a 2.5, or maybe a strong, lean, very strong, or a very strong, you know, they're gonna add in that nuance if you're in 0:58 between these levels, but in general, these are the types of ratings that they might give you. Some companies do 1 to 5, many do 1 to 4. It kinda depends if this is the general framework. 1:09 Next, they're gonna give an overall score. So let me let's say there's 4 skills, and they give you a 4, a 3, a 3, a 4, uhm, they're gonna then give an overall rating for you, the candidate. 1:21 So, you might get a strong hire. A strong hire means you're one of the strongest candidates they've come across, and, and they would kind of bang on the desk to get you in the door as a PM at their company. 1:32 A hire would mean that they think the candidate would have an impact, a positive impact, positive impact on the team. 1:38 A no hire would mean they're not confident that this candidate is gonna have a positive impact, and a strong no hire means that they are very confident that this candidate will not perform well in the job, uhm, that they're being evaluated for. 1:51 So, how does this, uh, tactically work? So, each interviewer is going to fill out some type of scorecard that is gonna look like this. 1:58 Let's say the interview is the analytics interview. So, they might, uh, have a couple different goal, uh, skills, like goal setting, metrics definition, anomaly detection, communication, there might be a section for any red flags or any hesitancies that they have about hiring, and they're gonna fill 2:14 in the blanks here and say, what score out of four for each one of these skills, and there's gonna be a section to say why. 2:19 So, they'll have a free text box to add in some more information to give, to give some color to the score that they're giving. 2:26 Below that, they're gonna give that overall hire, uhm, rating, and, and additionally explain why. Interviewers will combine their scores, uhm, across those different skills to then give a final hire score. 2:38 They'll also write down these notes so that when they go to a debrief session, which might be a week or two weeks later in some cases, they have those notes to refresh their memory and remember that. 2:48 Remember you, uhm, and your performance in the interview. So what do these interview debriefs look like? So each interviewer will join a 15 or 30 minute debrief session with all the other interviewers in the, uhm, interview loop for a specific candidate. 3:04 They'll go around the room or, or the zoom call, and they'll add that additional information or color to the overall score that they gave by referencing the interview. 3:13 Parts of your answer during the interview, uhm, they'll discuss any pros and cons for hiring that candidate. They'll highlight any red flags that they picked up on and if, especially if multiple people pick up on a red flag, they'll discuss that. 3:26 They'll bring up specifics about that PM role, uhm, whether it leans very technical or it, whether it's growth centric or whether it really needs a strong communicator or product sense, uhm, and they'll talk about how you, the candidate, might perform in that particular So, ultimately the hiring manager 3:42 is going to make that final call. Whether it's hire, no hire, or a let's wait. Uhm, for the specific candidate. 3:48 So, a hire means that you're going to go ahead and get that offer, which is super exciting. A no hire means they're going to pass on you, your performance wasn't high enough, uhm, for the bar that they've set. 3:59 And let's wait, this means that they did like you, you performed well, but they want to talk to more candidates first to see if there's someone with a bit of a better fit. 4:08 So, how do you actually use this to your advantage? Well, knowing this grading rubric for all the PM interviewers or interviews is going to give you a competitive edge because you don't have to guess at what they're actually looking for in your, in each interview. 4:22 You, you have a playbook, you're going to have all the rubrics. So, one tip here is to not stress too much about this. 4:30 your goal should be to consistently perform well in all the categories. But if you miss out a little bit on one but are exceptional in another area, you're still going to balance out with a positive score. 4:40 No one is perfect, especially in an interview setting where people are nervous, and interviewers know this. After all, they're human, they've interviewed as well, they're not perfect. 4:49 Uhm, if your scores are a bit lower but the interviewers still like you, you may still get an offer, uhm, but at a lower level than what they were initially interviewing for. 4:58 So, uhm, if you're applying for a senior PM role but your scores were a little bit weaker, but they still like you, you might get a product manager offer instead of a senior PM offer. 5:08 Uhm, and that's not a bad thing at all. The more offers you get, the better. So, check out all the grading rubrics, uhm, below this video in the, in the lesson, and within each module as well. 5:18 Again, you're really going to want to learn these rubrics, learn what they're looking for, and, what really differentiates a, a 4 versus a 3 versus a 2 and a 1. Again, your goal is to get as many 4s as possible and as many strong higher ratings as possible, so that you have the highest likelihood of 5:36 getting a product management offer. Alright, good luck, and I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to interpret PM interview grading rubrics and debrief decisions so you can tailor your answers to earn higher hire ratings and offers.,14cc6725-0024-46a8-b265-b94d440598b2,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Interview Grading Rubrics,4,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:19.869925+00
0a711c4bde534ad5936cc351b8f96aee,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over how to effectively prepare for a product management interview. The first thing to note here is that PM interviewers are 100% going to be able to tell whether or not you actually prepared for the interview. 00:14 And in today's job market, it is so critical to do so. Because there's a lot of fierce competition out there. 00:20 Within the first couple of minutes of an interview, the interviewer, is going to very clearly be able to tell, did you put in the work to prepare for that specific type of interview, whether it's product sense, product analytics, product strategy, etc. 00:35 As well as, did you prepare for an interview at this specific company for this specific role. Now, that first impression that they're going to get in the first couple of minutes, based on how you are performing, how you're communicating, is going to last throughout the interview. 00:48 The entire interview, and it will impact your score. So I really want to just emphasize that you really have to prepare for these PM interviews. 00:57 A lot of the candidates out there that you're competing against are putting in a ton of work to prepare, and that means that you have to do the same as well. 01:04 All right. So there really are two parts of preparation work. Number one is general product management interview preparation. So, That is really understanding product management, understanding the terminology, the type of work that they're doing on a day-to-day basis. 01:21 Now, if you're already a product manager, you really know this, but if you're pivoting into product management from a related role, you're really going to want to get much more familiar with the day-to-day of a product manager. 01:34 How do they talk? What do they talk about? What are the different things to emphasize? What should they be thinking about during the product development process? 01:42 Um, if you're an engineer, if you're an analyst, a designer, you are a part of the product development process, but you need to learn all the other aspects of the product development process so that you can really speak confidently in your interviews. 01:57 So, really, the takeaway here is that you need to have that strong understanding of product, um, so that you can effectively communicate in these interviews. 02:06 The next is doing a lot of practice with every type of product management interview that you might encounter. Whether that is product sense, or otherwise known as product design, that interview is asked in almost every interview loop that you'll come across. 02:21 Product strategy, technical, estimation, analytics, etc. Execution, behavioral, cross-functional, these are all the different types of product management interviews that you could come across, and you really have to do a lot of practice with each one. 02:36 I recommend doing at least three or four mock interviews with yourself, um, for all the interview types. And if you think that you're struggling with a particular interview type, like product analytics, for example, I highly recommend. 02:48 I highly encourage you to set up a coaching call to do a mock interview and get some live, actionable feedback. 02:55 The number one way to get better at this is by doing it, by actually practicing. You could, uhm, learn about it for forever, really. 03:04 You could, uhm, go through the lessons, you could read books, you could read articles, you could read practice questions, But it's not until you actually actually do a mock interview, and you can do it with yourself, so you can open up Google Meets or Zoom or Photo Booth or any type of video thing, uhm 03:22 , recording platform, even Loom, which is how I'm recording this, and actually record yourself going through the prompt and then watch it back and, uhm, grade yourself. 03:31 See how you did. See if you were stumbling in different sections or rambling or not staying focused. Doing this several times will make you very comfortable at doing these types of interviews, and I won't lie, like, these interviews are strange. 03:45 They're sometimes awkward, because you're just talking to the camera, solving a problem out loud, and it's not something that people do in, in their day-to-day life, so you have to practice at it, you have to record yourself, watch it back, grade yourself, and then iterate over time, and if you're struggling 04:03 , or you want an extra set of eyes from a professional, from a product manager, feel free to book a coaching call to go over and do a mock interview so that you can get that actual feedback. 04:13 Alright, the next portion of preparation work is role-specific. So number one, first and foremost, is researching into the company and the role. 04:23 So I've made this really easy. On Product Career List, in the job section, you have a place to put in the job description, and that allows you to just reference back to it at a later date. 04:35 But going back, researching into the company. So you can go over to the company research tab and click into all these vectors. 04:42 And Product CareerList makes it very easy to just quickly run research. on all of these different aspects of a company. 04:51 So, for example, this is a product lead position at Nourish. And you can go in here, go look at the product, and it will automatically figure out what are all the components of this product. 05:02 So, okay, you have access to registered dietitians, it's done through telehealth, you get care plans. Oh, and it's also covered by insurance. 05:11 It also cites the sources. So, you can link out, uhm, and read more about where it, uh, got this information. 05:19 It will break down user types, so, okay, uhm, we're, we're working with individuals with specific health conditions, athletes, individuals looking to lose weight, uhm, going down, uh, engagement with health and wellness contents, content, interest in telehealth. 05:36 so It's doing this research, you can learn more about all these different aspects of the company. Competition, healthy, well, wellery, food smart, what are the risks and challenges? 05:47 Okay, so there might be regulatory changes, there might be competition, tech advancements, uhm, what did they launch recently? What is their strategy? 05:57 Who is funding this company? Uhm, what partnerships have they done? What are their what feedback have they gotten? Uhm, can you summarize the business model? 06:05 So what are their revenue streams? What are their service offerings? Doing this research is really, really easy through Product Realist. 06:12 All you have to do then is read it and understand it, ingest it, uhm, and really get to know the company at a deeper level. 06:19 The next piece of, uh, uh, advice I have here is actually using the product. So, go to the product, uhm, and, you know, maybe signing up for an account, going through their flows, trying to sign up, trying to access the service. Now, you don't have to actually, like, pay for the service. 06:38 That would cost a lot of money based on all the, the companies that you're applying to. But, if you, if you do make it to a final round, like, it might be worth it to actually go through and whether, whether or whatever the product is, like, try to book something or try to go through their core flows 06:54 , you're going to get familiar with the product. And this is really helpful because sometimes a recruiter, a hiring manager, someone will kind of try to throw you off guard by asking you a question and saying, you know, what, what do you like about the product? 07:08 Or what do you think we can improve about the product? And it'll become very clear in that moment. Whether or not you did use the product or not, and the candidates who are getting offers are the ones that are going out there and they're doing that level of investigation and research and preparation 07:24 work to use the product. So you don't want to get caught off guard by not using the product and not having anything to say in those scenarios. 07:33 So do research on product career list actually click through the flows try to use the product, get familiar with it so that you can really be prepared for anything that comes your way during the actual interview. 07:44 The next is coming up with the right questions to ask in each interview. So at the end of every single interview that you'll have, you'll typically have five or 10 minutes to ask questions to the interviewer and it's a really bad look and it leaves not a great impression. 08:01 If you just don't ask very surface level questions, a surface level question might be, um, so, you know, what do you do during day to day or how big is the team? 08:10 These are very basic questions that aren't going to be interesting to the interviewer at all. You're, it comes across as you're just asking questions to ask them, not because you really care about the company or about the role. 08:24 And so, um, what do I've done in, uh, product career list is within the interview section, you can actually add an interview so you can select, um, whatever interview you want, schedule it and, um, click into it. 08:37 You can put down who is the actual interviewer that you're going to be talking to, and then you can click generate questions and it will come up with these very customized questions based on not only the interview. 08:49 But also the job description as well. Um, so, uh, and if you've done company research, it'll incorporate that in as well. 08:58 So, um, if you go down here, you can see, okay, with the rapid expansion into all 50 states, blah, blah, blah. 09:04 What strategies has Nourish implemented to prioritize future development that caters to both individual needs of each condition and the overarching goal. 09:13 Or this one, um, grow, uh, given Nourish's mission to integrate telehealth and personalized nutrition, how do you balance between creating an intuitive user experience for patients of varying tech savviness and maintaining the complexity needed for providers to deliver personalized care effectively? 09:31 So, these are not surface level questions at all. They go deep. They're really interesting and and the idea here is when you're talking to Nick in the interview in that last 5-10 minutes and you ask a question like this, Nick is gonna be really excited to talk about this question because it has everything 09:49 to do with his day-to-day work and people love talking about their work. So, if you can really, um, make something interesting and spark that conversation, you're gonna leave a, a great last impression which is, um, for, in, in terms of recency bias, like, the last thing that they hear is gonna have 10:07 a longer impact on the, the, kind of, everything that happened in the middle of an interview. So, what you could do here is then you can edit this and say, you know, I want to, um, take out this part or change it, and then you could actually type in the response. 10:22 So, what are they saying in response to this question? You can say, they said this, you could save that, and now, um, later when you're trying to remember everything that happened in all these interviews, you can go back here and you can reference it. 10:38 And this might be helpful, helpful if you are sending a thank you note or if you are trying to reference something that you heard during an offer negotiation or something like that. 10:47 It's good to keep everything in one place. Um, so, that's what I really recommend to come up with these customized questions that are going to leave a lasting impression. 10:57 You don't want to wait to the last minute to do this, um, in terms of, like, in the moment coming up with a question. 11:04 You should really prepare in advance so that you know what you're going to ask each interviewer. Um, the other thing that I recommend here is when you ask one of these questions, they're going to give you a response. 11:14 And, instead of just saying, okay, on to the next, you could ask them a follow-up question to what they're saying. 11:20 And, this shows that you were actively listening, which, again, going to, back to a previous lesson, is an important skill for you to demonstrate, um, as well as curiosity. 11:30 So, if you can ask those types of interesting follow-ups, saying, okay, so I'm hearing you said X, Y, Z, well, what about this? 11:37 Or, can you explain or expand on this piece a bit more? Or, injecting some type of interesting information to show that you're an engaged, uh, candidate. 11:47 You really are someone that could come into this role, and you could start immediately adding value by asking the right questions and bringing up the right things. 11:56 So, doing all of this in the last five to ten minutes of an interview is really important, and it can could really set you apart from other candidates. 12:05 Um, and the last piece here is nailing down your why this company story. So, in any interview, whether it's the recruiter, the hiring manager, or other interviews, they might ask you, like, why are you interested in Nourish specifically? 12:20 And having that story prepared is going to really, really help you because you don't want to come up with that on the spot because it's just not going to be as strong as if you were to prepare for it. 12:32 Um, so, check out the other lesson where we go into this question specifically and what you can say. Um, but that's one of the other pieces that is specific to a company and a role that you'll want to prepare for beforehand so you're not caught off guard and that you can leave a lasting impression when 12:49 you answer this question. Alright, well that's it for this lesson and I'll see you in the next one.",Learn how to prepare for product management interviews by practicing key question types and researching the company so you can communicate confidently and leave a stronger impression.,e8814967-70af-4b26-b0a7-9d412d2bc38e,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Preparing For Your Interview,5,TRUE,13,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:20.320406+00
b45c706efab646f6b66759e18e12c7db,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over different tips and tricks that I recommend you follow throughout your PM interviews. 00:06 So, starting off, right off the bat, the number one tip is to be positive and passionate in your interviews. The interviewers are going to build off of your energy, the energy that you are giving in the interview. 00:18 And you, if you show up for your interview and you're low energy, you're nervous, you're not passionate, etc. You're not going to leave that positive impression on your interview, the, your interviewer. 00:29 The interviewer is going to just feel kind of meh about you as a candidate. You know, you're not going to set yourself apart in any way, and you really want to avoid this. 00:38 So, try to hype yourself up before an interview. Think about how exciting it would be to actually work at that company and, and work with the people that you're interviewing with. 00:47 Like, these will be your clients. Your co-workers, if you do get an offer. So, bring that positive energy to every one of your interviews. 00:54 I know this is very difficult, especially in a long day, when there might be hours of interviews, but try to do that type of work to hype yourself up, whether it's listening to music that you really love, or watching some type of hype-up video on YouTube. Get those nervous jitters before an interview 01:14 , and bring that excited, positive energy to the interview, and I guarantee your interviewer is going to build off of that energy, and feel much better about doing the interview as well. 01:25 I mean, the interviewers, they have long days as well. They're in tons of meetings. They're doing a lot of work with their engineering teams, and writing PRDs, and then they go into an hour interview, where they have. 01:36 to very actively listen, take notes on the interview, uh, interviewee's performance, and if you can bring fun, positive energy into that interview, it's really going to make a big difference. 01:48 The next piece is always to remember to emphasize impact over everything. So if there is one thing that they're going to remember from your answers, it's that you were able to create a lasting impact. 02:00 On the company and their products, they want to know that you can deliver these results. If you have just, uh, if you've worked in several positions and just completed tasks, they won't be impressed. 02:11 But if you actually were able to change the dynamics of a company or the product in any way, they'll be much more excited about having you join, um, their team and doing the same with their product. 02:23 No one wants a product manager. Just come along and manage a JIRA board or be a project manager. They want the product manager to drive impact, to drive outcomes. 02:34 What does that mean? That means changing core metrics to that are important to the company, whether it's acquisition. So that would mean, let's say, a hundred people land on the marketing page, the landing page of a product. 02:48 I'm. Right now, let's say 20 of them start a free trial. Let's get up that got up to 25 or 30 or 40 people that would significantly change the fundamentals about that business retention. 03:01 Let's say that the one month retention rate is 60%. Can you get that up to 65, 70, 75%? These are, this is impact. 03:11 These are outcomes that push the product managers are positioned to drive. No one else really is positioned to drive these changes other than maybe a growth team who is bringing more people to the platform or a customer support team who's able to retain more users by helping them through their needs 03:29 and through their challenges, but the product managers are really the drivers of those outcomes. So when you're in these interviews talk about how you you can drive those core metrics over everything else. 03:40 They do not care that you can manage a Jira board that you can open tickets. They do care that you can actually drive outcomes and and have a big impact on the company. 03:50 The next is to explain stuff when it's applicable. So remember that your interviewer has absolutely no idea what you're talking about because they just met you. 03:59 They're learning about your experiences. Is for the first time, they probably don't know your previous or current company. So imagine how frustrating it would be for an interviewer. 04:08 If you started off by saying, uh, if they asked, tell me about yourself and you say, sure, I'm at air DNA and I've been working on improving the DNA eligibility intake system to better facilitate new records so that the bioengineers can make optimizations to the downstream systems. 04:23 The interviewer is, has absolutely no idea what you're talking about. And they're just going to be confused. They're not going to understand your impact or your roles and responsibility. 04:32 You have to dumb things down for them. You have to make it clear what you're talking about. Otherwise, again, there, you're not going to score well because they just won't be able to understand. 04:42 So instead of using jargon and product names that have no meaning to them, explain everything like they're just hearing. It for the first time because they are or think about it like you're talking to a 10 year old. 04:54 Now, of course, these people are smart. They're intelligent. Um, so you don't want to dumb it down too much, but think about how you might explain something to a 10 year old who has no familiarity with, you know, your product or your company, try to make it easy for them to understand. 05:10 And they're going to be able to retain that information much better. The next piece, and I went over this in a previous lesson, is to make sure to research the company. 05:18 I cannot emphasize this enough. It is so important to do this, and I see it often, uh, where candidates don't actually look into what the company does and how it operates. 05:28 And why would a company hire someone who doesn't care to even look into the product and see how it works? 05:34 That would be very risky for them, and as I went over in a previous lesson. The companies are trying to avoid any type of risk when hiring candidates. 05:42 So, use Product Career List, as I went over in the previous lesson, to understand the company's business model. How do they make money? Their acquisition, uh, strategy. How do they get customers? 05:52 Their product suite, like, what do their users use? How do they use the product? Who are the users? Uhm, and who are their main competitors? 06:00 Who are they competing with? Competing against for attention, for sales, for revenue, for retention. Alright, next, ask amazing questions. The questions you ask your interviewers can either help you or hurt you. 06:12 And I also went, uh, over this in the preparation lesson, but I want to explain this a little bit more. 06:18 So, how can asking bad questions hurt you? If you ask basic questions that aren't interesting, or are too high-level, the interviewer is going to know that you really don't care about this role. 06:32 You're not interested in it. You're not curious about it. And that's just not going to leave a good impression. It can, on the flip side, help you if you ask intelligent, well-researched, thought-provoking questions. 06:43 Because it'll show, okay, this is a, this is potentially a thought partner for when this person comes onto your team. 06:50 I know that, you know, if I hire this candidate, if I give them a strong higher rating, that they're going to come in on day one and start asking really important questions, asking, uh, really intriguing questions that lead us down the right path to improve our product. 07:05 So, imagine, uh, an interviewer who is interviewing a famous actor. The question could be, so, what was it like kissing x, y, z, z in the final scene? 07:15 This is such a basic question that everyone is asking. It's, it's just based on popularity and it's very surface level, versus a question that might say, the role of Dean had similarities to your previous work, like Christopher in movie Y, who, who really had mental health struggles. 07:31 But I think a key difference is that Dean had spent a considerable amount of effort working through his demons, albeit not very well. 07:37 How did you prepare for this role to account for the nuance between a character like Christopher and Dean, given the similarities but slight differences? 07:47 This is a much more interesting question. It shows you really researched this actor. You know about their previous work. You know about the current role. 07:56 And you're asking something that is so thought-provoking that they've never heard before. That actor is Dean. It's going to light up and be so much more excited to talk about that versus this very basic question that they're getting asked a lot. 08:09 So try to think about this when you're going into these interviews. I know it might seem, you know, really dramatic to think about the questions at the end of the interview like this. 08:19 But this is going to help make the difference between you and another candidate. Think about all the candidates. There are that are coming into these final round interviews. 08:27 They're very qualified. They're really good communicators. They're just as strong as you. And so if they do well in the interview, in a product strategy interview, and you do well in a product strategy interview, how are they going to tell the difference between these two candidates? 08:42 And it might come down to the questions that you're asking at the end, the, the passion, the curiosity that you have about that role. 08:49 All right. Next, make sure that you are prepared. Again, I went over this, but I wanted to reiterate it. It would be a shame if you spent three to five hours of your time in an interview, if you weren't actually prepared to have that interview. 09:04 That is a lot of time. You might have to actually take a day off from work and dedicate time to doing these interviews. 09:09 And if you're just going to not get an offer because you weren't prepared, it's just a waste of time. You might as well have not done it. 09:16 So, um, in that lesson, I'm, I go over, if you haven't watched it, the best ways to prepare for your interview. 09:22 What is important to note is that you need to do this. This is not a minimum wage job. This is a very visible, critical role within a high-functioning tech team. 09:32 So you want to take time to prepare. As I mentioned in another lesson, an engineering team, let's say that it has five engineers on it, and each engineer is making $200,000 a year. 09:43 So just in salary, that's a million dollars worth of revenue or kind of company funds that the company is using for that team. 09:52 Now you factor in benefits and, um, health insurance and all that type of stuff. That $1 million amount goes up. 10:00 Now factor in the designer, the engineer. Analyst, um, the other supporting roles like researchers, there's a lot of money that's put into one team. 10:09 And so the product manager is deciding what that team, what that group of people work So you have to be prepared for this. 10:17 This, this isn't the type of job where you can just come in and, you know, wing it. You have to do that pre-work to be prepared in any and come off as an intelligent, strong, effective candidate. 10:30 Um, additionally, you have to practice. Part of this is practicing and improving over time, um, so that you are really strong when it comes to these case study style interviews. 10:42 The next piece is using frameworks. And I'll go into this in other lessons, but you want to use frameworks because other people wise, if, if you're going into these interviews without any type of methodical or structured thought process, the biggest takeaway the interviewers are going to have is that 10:58 you are chaotic. You're not a structured thinker and you're not going to provide structure when you come onto the team. 11:04 So frameworks, um, they could be used as a tool that you can deploy to answer these questions effectively. The frameworks are valuable because, again, they allow you and empower you to approach a question in a structured but comprehensive way. 11:21 Just make sure to not be too rigid in sticking to a framework in every single question that you get because you might need to be spontaneous and stray away from a framework if the question that you're asked isn't exactly the type of question that you've prepared for, if that makes sense. 11:37 So use them. Let them study them, learn them, but you might need to kind of wiggle around in different areas based on the question that you're being asked. 11:46 The next piece is do not ramble. One of the worst things that you can do in an interview is ramble on and on about something. 11:54 It demonstrates that you don't have the ability to think clearly and structure your answers in an easy to digest way. 12:00 If you find yourself halfway through a given answer and think that it won't represent your skill set or experience in a positive light because you're rambling, you're not getting to the point, you could say, you know, I actually remembered a different example that more directly answers your question. 12:14 Would you mind if I shared that story instead? And your interviewer will almost definitely say, yes, that is totally fine. 12:21 Also, understand how long you should be spending answering each question. I very oftentimes see this with candidates where they don't have that type of information and then they approach answering the question in, in, uh, not the best way because they're talking way too much or way too little, uh, about 12:40 answering it. So, um, if the question is more behavioral, like, tell me about a time when you did this. Spend about two to three minutes answering that question. 12:49 You don't want to go on and for five, 10 minutes. Um, I've, I've been in interviews where the candidate, after asking the question, tell me about yourself. 12:58 We'll, we'll literally talk for 10 or 15 minutes. This is completely inappropriate to do in an interview. You, you only want to talk, um, about the story, about the question, um, for a couple of minutes before the interviewer then can ask you for follow-up questions. 13:15 If you're in a case study, um, interview like product sense or product strategy, you'll want to spend like 5 to 10 minutes for each part of the framework. 13:23 Um, I'll go into more information about that in those lessons, but that's where you are going to be spending a little bit more time talking and the interviewer will, um, have fewer questions for you as you go throughout it. 13:36 Um, the next piece is don't be shy. Don't be too honest in these interviews. So what I mean by this is remember that the interviewers are trying to find red flags in your answers. 13:46 Their goal, again, is to hire the least risky candidate. So if you accidentally share something that could be viewed as a red flag by way of being too honest, you're going to hurt your chances of getting hired. 13:59 You, you know, you don't want to lie about your experience and paint your experience in a different light, but you don't have to include every single thing about every past role in your answers. 14:11 So examples of some things not to admit. You don't want to say, I've actually never used your product and don't really know what it This is being too honest. 14:21 You don't want to bring this up if, if you haven't done that pre-work or you could say, I- ended up disregarding the feedback my tech lead gave to me about the feature we were working on because, frankly, they had never worked on that type of thing before and I had. 14:34 This is way too honest. You're going to come across as having a massive ego and they will almost definitely not hire you over a different candidate if you say something like this. 14:43 And it could be very, uh, you know, one comment like this that throws off the entire score. So, you know, be careful about that. 14:50 About what you're saying, especially if you are in overshare, try to hold back and only say what is being asked of you and avoid giving them red flags, um, when you, when, when it's in your control. 15:03 The last piece, I don't really like using data to make decisions because I think relying on data gets in the way of true innovation. 15:11 I've had someone in my career say this and it, they lose complete credibility. Credibility, because data is such a core part of, an accepted core part of product development, of launching startups, of launching features, of growing companies. 15:26 You don't want to be too honest and say that you have some type of philosophy like this because it will be a red flag and you will not get an offer. 15:35 The next is to dress and behave professionally. You want to be seen. As a professional in this interview, not as a casual friend, tech is different than other industries and, and definitely more casual. 15:46 So don't wear a suit to your interview. Don't, you know, you know, you don't have to wear like a button down shirt or a tie or anything, but I do recommend you dressing, um, a step above casual. 15:58 You don't want to wear like just a basic t-shirt or a graphic tee. You want to, you know, maybe just a, a, a regular, um, button down shirt, but you don't have to wear business professional, if that makes sense. 16:10 The other piece is act professionally. Like, act as if you were meeting the CEO. You don't want to swear in your interviews. 16:18 You don't want to bring up too many aspects of your personal life. Like, this is a job interview, not a date. 16:23 I've had candidates when I say, um, tell me about yourself. They'll talk about their personal life. They'll talk about being married or, you know, um, their travel plans, stuff like that. 16:32 This is not appropriate to include in an interview. You just want to leave it out. Focus on your professional experience. 16:39 You want to be on time to the interview. So unless there is an emergency that you have to deal with, you should absolutely be there before the start time. 16:47 Log on to the Zoom call or be ready with your phone. Without Do Not Disturb On, before the time, make sure that things are working. 16:56 Make sure that your Google Chrome has the permissions for the video software. Like, do this pre-work to make sure that the moment they log on to the interview, you are ready to go, you're there, uhm, and ready to engage in that interview. 17:09 I, I like to say that being early is on time. Being on time is late. And being late is on time. 17:15 Unacceptable. Again, except for extenuating circumstances and emergencies. Always be gracious of the interviewer's time. You want to thank them for speaking with you because it takes a lot of time for the interviewers to, uh, interview you and all the other candidates. 17:30 All right. So those are the tips and tricks that I recommend you to follow throughout your product management interviews. Again, try to keep these in mind, doing these are going to set you up for success. 17:41 They're going to set you apart from other candidates. The market is really competitive. There's tons of really great candidates out there that are strong, that have a lot of experience, five, 10 years of experience in their craft, in their industry. 17:54 And how are the companies going to be able to set apart different candidates when there's a lot of pros about two candidates? 18:02 They're going to look for you. For these differentiators, they're going to look for red flags. They're going to say, oh, well, candidate A, um, had this one red flag and can it be, just seems less risky. 18:12 And, um, given their experience, I think we should go with candidate B. You want to keep all of this in mind because it ultimately does impact your offer and, and the chances that you have to land that offer. 18:24 All right, good luck. And I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to apply proven PM interview tactics like showing passion, emphasizing impact, communicating clearly, and avoiding red flags so you can improve your chances of getting an offer.",8c56385e-fe2a-4fef-9c3c-96bb5c6d5c70,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Interview Tips & Tricks,6,TRUE,19,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:20.779444+00
154165cb511c4447879178f344469ad1,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over one of the overarching product management interview frameworks that you can deploy to provide and deliver an effective answer. 00:09 So, there are really two types of frameworks. PM interviews are typically covering a specific theme or skill. So, think technical, product design, analytics, execution, cross-functional. 00:20 Within each of these categories, there are specific frameworks that you can follow. And so, in the lessons within those modules, I'm going to share those specific frameworks that you can follow to always and consistently produce an excellent, structured answer. 00:35 But in this lesson, I'm going to cover an overarching framework that you can apply to all of those case-style interview questions and answers. 00:44 You should keep this overarching framework in mind for all these interview types. Um, these are easy to forget, so I encourage you to write this down, and this is going to be a core part of your practice. 00:54 So, this is the framework that I recommend. It's broken down into three different sections, so, um, think about your answer being 45 minutes long. 01:04 The first part, a couple minutes at the beginning, maybe five minutes. This is going to be where you start. Um, then, you're going to be the middle section, this is the meat of your answer. 01:16 This is where you're going to go through this answer loop. Um, so, that's going to be about 40 minutes long. 01:23 And then at the end, you're going to quickly summarize and bring everything together and summarize your answer. And that can be done in one or two minutes. 01:32 So, I'm going to dive into each piece here, but the biggest piece to take away from this slide is, you're starting off, uhm, right here, uhm, with your answer. 01:41 Then you're going into this answer loop. So, you're going to go through these four pieces here and then loop back through every part of your interview answer. 01:51 So, just to provide a quick example, let's say in the Product Sense interview, you want to talk about users, then pain points, then solutions. 02:00 So, you'll go through these four steps for users, then you'll loop back to the top to go through the pain points. 02:07 And then you'll loop back to go through solutions. And it's through that loop pattern where you're then methodically solving the problem. 02:15 So, let's dive into the first one here within the start section. And this is listening and interpreting the question that you are asked. 02:23 So you want to really engage. It's fully at this stage. Active listening is very important. You don't, you don't want to just hear the question. 02:30 You, you want to really absorb the question. Like, what are they asking? Why are they asking this? Why did they come up with this interview question specifically? 02:38 You want to capture those key details. So, write down important keywords or constraints that they are delivering to you in the interview prompt. 02:47 Sometimes the interview prompt is as simple as improve Netflix. But, other times, the details that you get could be five minutes long or ten minutes long. 02:57 You're going to want to take notes during that process depending on the level of information they're sharing so that you can reference it later on. 03:05 In the same way that if you were in a meeting with someone, a co-worker, you're going to be taking notes on what they're saying so that you really absorb it and, and can reference it later on. 03:15 You also want to demonstrate enthusiasm at that, at this stage. So, approach the question with visible interest and energy. Say, that is a very interesting question. 03:24 I'm, I'm excited to dive in here. The next is staying present. Avoid distractions like your phone or notifications. Ensure your body language reflects engagement and curiosity. 03:35 You know, don't look off to the side. Like, really pay attention to the interviewer, um, so that they know that you're engaged. 03:41 The next piece is clarify. So, there's another lesson with clarifying questions that you can go over, but you always want to ask questions. 03:50 Even if the question seems very straightforward, you, you have to ask at least one, but ideally a couple, three, four, five questions to ensure that you are aligned with the interviewer. 04:02 You want to define the scope, so confirming key details, like the target users, the platforms, the market focus, domestic, international, is it, what, what aspect of the strategy are we focused on? 04:14 Getting those additional details will help you define the scope of the problem. You also want to uncover constraints. So, identify any technical, business, or resource limitations. 04:25 That could impact your interview answer. And then, check for any hidden assumptions. Make sure that you and your interviewer are thinking about the problem in the same way. 04:34 You're speaking a common language. And last, confirm your understanding of the prompt. So, if no other questions are coming up in your head, you want to just restate the prompt to validate your interpretation. 04:46 So, you might say, alright, thanks. So, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to x, y, z. Does that sound right to you? 04:53 You're just re- regurgitating it, restating it back to the interviewer just to make sure that you two are in lockstep. 04:59 Because one of the biggest mistakes that you can make is interpreting a question differently and spending 40 minutes answering a question in the wrong direction. 05:08 So, the next piece is pausing and planning. There's a lesson that goes over this in detail, but it's a You want to resist the urge to respond immediately. 05:16 Take a moment before speaking to come up with a structure and ensure that you're answering the prompt thoughtfully. The structure is oftentimes going to be those specific frameworks that I mentioned before in all the interview types. 05:29 So, it'll already be top of mind. You're not going to have to come up with it on the spot, um, unless the question is slightly different, in which case you're going to take pieces of the framework. 05:39 The next is pausing. A brief pause is going to allow you to structure your thoughts. And, quality over speed is really important here. 05:47 Interviewers are going to prefer a well-structured response over a rushed and chaotic one where you're jumping all around to different things. 05:55 There's no structure to it. You want to stay composed as well. Even if it feels unnatural to pause, especially if you're someone who talks a lot and, and doesn't like silence and you want to fill the space, you, you need to pause to just collect your thought. 06:09 And it signals that you're confident, uh, and deliberate about your interview answer. You're not just coming across as very chaotic and jumping right into the, uh, the answer. 06:19 Finally, you'll want to communicate your approach. So, state your approach up front. Like, how are you going to answer this question? 06:26 What is your mental model of the structure of how you're going to break down this, uh, question and use a clear structure here. 06:34 When you're, when you're communicating this, organize your response. Say, I'm going to cover three options, their trade-offs, and then a recommendation, or I'm going to start with the goal that I'm going to discuss the users, et cetera, just list out your process so that they can follow along when you're 06:49 asking actually going through the answer. And then keep them aligned. Make sure that they understand this. Um, and, uh, finally, uh, you might want to leverage visual aid. 07:00 So sometimes candidates will use a Google doc or a whiteboarding app like Miro or Figma Jamboards to reinforce this structure so that it's just so easy for the interviewer to follow along with their thought process. 07:13 And I'll and just setting this expectation, um, will be important so that you can communicate and, and help guide the discussion effectively. 07:23 All right. Next piece is this interview answer loop where you're answering the question. So here you're going to want to introduce the part of your answer. 07:32 So let's say you, there are going to be three parts of your answer. This is where you're introducing that. So. 07:37 You'll want to transition smoothly into, into each, uh, part of your answer and communicate the starting point of that piece. 07:45 So signal start of each section to make sure that they're aligned and they know where you're Restate your approach, remind the interviewer how it fits into the overall answer. 07:57 So you might say, okay, now we're on to brainstorming solutions. And so we can. Covered the goal, we covered users. 08:03 Now we're at the solution phase. Um, that's going to help them understand in this plan that you came up with at the beginning that you communicated, where are you and keep it concise. 08:13 You don't have to restate everything. Just give a brief intro of where you're at to focus the interview and make sure that they're following along. 08:21 So you might say, okay, let's start with the first approach, improving user Through personalized recommendations. I'm going to walk through why this is important, how it can be implemented, and then the tradeoffs involved before moving on to the second approach or the next approach. 08:36 Then pause to brainstorm. Take a few seconds to generate ideas, jot down different key points that you want to bring up before speaking to ensure a structured response. 08:46 So at each part of your answer, you can spend time. 20, 30 seconds a minute, just doing a brainstorm, either on the whiteboard or writing down in front of you to get your thoughts concise and just get them down there. 09:01 You want to identify tradeoffs and considerations, so think through these challenges or alternate approaches when you're doing this brainstorm. Prioritize different insights, like when you're paused, think about, okay, I'm going to talk about this thing, I want to talk about that thing, uhm, and that 09:18 will allow you to avoid just going in all these different directions as you're talking. Uhm, if you write it down before, you can just, you, you already know what you want to cover when you're actually talking. 09:30 And then, write short notes and words. Do not write full sentences down, you don't have time to do that, just write quick notes and keywords. 09:38 Words that you know what to talk about, so you could write recommendations, relevance, personalized privacy, ML models. From these five words or phrases, you can easily talk about this now for a couple minutes in a structured manner without starting to talk about recommendations and then saying, oh, 09:54 I think they should be personalized, or, oh, we need to, uhm, think about privacy, and, and just like going or being chaotic and going crazy. 10:02 Going in different directions with it. If you write this down first during your pause and during your brainstorm, then you can really methodically address each part of the answer. 10:13 Then is when you're presenting and explaining, so this is where, uhm, you're explaining the part of the answer, you're, uh, you're going deep with it, and remember to really take the or through your thought process here. 10:27 They cannot read your mind, so if you have an assumption in your head, you're, you're thinking, okay, I'm, I'm assuming that their North Star is this. You, you need to say that out loud and align with the interviewer because otherwise they have, they have no idea what you're thinking. 10:41 Uhm, and when you're doing this, you want to communicate it in a structured way and avoid jumping around or talking in circles. 10:50 Which leads to the next piece, which is checking in and adjusting as needed. Even with a well-structured approach, like, things don't always go as planned. 10:58 You want to stay flexible and adjust smoothly when it makes sense. So, watch for interview, interviewer cues. If the interviewer looks confused or disengaged, you want to check in with them. 11:10 You want to say something like, I've covered the first part of my answer. Before moving on, does this offer any align with what you were expecting? 11:15 And just check in to make sure this is what you would do in a normal conversation. If you're explaining something complex in a meeting, you might say, alright, I'm going to pause here. 11:24 Like, does anyone have questions about this, uhm, that I can clarify? The next is you might want to course correct midway through. 11:31 So, if you realize a flaw in your answer, you could pivot naturally. You might say, as I'm explaining this, I'm realizing that there is actually a better approach. 11:39 Let me refine my answer slightly to account for X, Y, Z. And then, you might want to recover from forgetting a point. 11:47 So, if you lose track, uh, of your answer, take a moment to just gather your thoughts. And then, you might say, I'm going to take a second to just think through the next part of my answer, if that's alright. 11:57 Interviewers are nice people. They're going to say, sure, makes sense. You can pause, just think through about what you were trying to say, and then get back on track. 12:06 Next is summarize. So, this is the ending stage of your interview answer. So, you're going to want to clearly summarize. 12:14 You want to reinforce the structured approach that you took by restating those key points. You want to connect it to the original question. So, improve Netflix. You, you want to go at the end of your interview answer, you're going to say, so, we were, I was tasked with improving Netflix. 12:30 The way I approached this was taking a look at who are the users of Netflix, and what is the goal of Netflix. 12:36 Uhm, just quickly kind of go through your process, keep it to 30 seconds, could go up to 60 seconds if you want, but you want to avoid, like, over-explaining and rehashing every single part of the, the answer. 12:50 I'm but if you do this, you're going to really just wrap things up in a nice bow, and leave the interviewer, uhm, fully aligned on how you approached the answer. 12:59 Alright, thank you for joining this lesson. Uhm, in the next couple of lessons, I'll show a couple more frameworks that you can deploy for different types of interview questions that you might get, more behavioral in nature. 13:10 Again, this one was more focused on how to approach the case study. Style interview questions like product sense, analytics, etc. 13:18 Alright, I'll see you in that next lesson.

2dc20a8c8303450ca1a728353d15044c,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over another PM interview framework that I call the Diamond Method. So, this one is very specific to open-ended questions. 00:09 So, in an interview, you might be asked an open-ended question like, What social media platform do you think is best positioned for long-term success? 00:17 And what factors contribute to this? Or, which company outside of the tech industry is most likely to become a major player? 00:24 Or, what is the most significant challenge facing AI development in the next five years, and how should it be addressed? 00:32 Or, what traditional industry is most ripe for disruption through digital innovation, and how would you approach it? So, these are all questions that are very open-ended in nature. 00:43 You can take it in any direction, and they're looking for your opinion on it. How are you thinking through a question like this? 00:51 These, uh, you might get in a behavioral type interview, or they'll come in a product strategy interview, and there's a, uh, a specific framework that I recommend there. 01:00 But, you might just, in any type of interview, be asked this type of open-ended question. So, how do you approach answering this in a methodical and structured way? 01:11 Now, it would be very bad if you took a question like, what company outside of the tech industry is most likely to become a major player in tech, and why? 01:19 And you said something like, I think it's the, the healthcare industry. That would be the wrong answer. Uh, because you're just giving a, a short explanation or answer of what you think, you're not actually exploring different options and diving deep into understanding why. 01:35 You'll always, they're not looking for your just hot take on something. They're looking for you if they ask a question like this to dive deep into it, explore different options, talk through it in an intelligent way, um, in the same way that, uh, if you can imagine a tech CEO or a CEO is being interviewed 01:54 on stage and there's an audience there, they're going to want to hear those deeper thoughts and deeper, uh, feelings. Feelings or, or, um, vectors about their, how they're thinking about this problem before they give their final answer. 02:06 So what I recommend doing here is the diamond method. So to answer these questions, what you could do is go through these three different steps. 02:15 So number one, you would explore several options. You would then choose one and justify why you're choosing that and then going deep down explaining that. 02:24 So um, it, it, you could think of it like a diamond. So on each side of the diamond here, you're exploring one option, another option, a third option, and then you might choose one and say, okay, now I'm going to go deep with this particular option. 02:37 So say you pick option three, you'd go deep with it, explain it in much more detail, um, getting into the weeds a bit before saying, you know, this is my, my conclusion. 02:46 This is my final answer, um, for this specific prompt. So let's go through an example to explain how you could deploy the diamond method in an interview and, uh, interview answer. 02:56 So let's say the question is what social media platform is best positioned for long-term success and what factors contribute to this. 03:04 So what you would first do is explore several options. So you might say, okay, so the first, uh, social media platform, where I think might be YouTube. Because YouTube is dominant in video content, which is continuing to go grow in demand, especially in 2025 next, you know, they have a strong revenue 03:19 model through ad subscriptions like YouTube premium and, um, the creators have a great monetization method there. And then, last, it's owned by Google and it really can benefit from all the resources has been making over the recent, um, couple of years. 03:40 Next is TikTok. TikTok is rapidly continuing to grow their user base, especially among Gen Z, but they've also started to expand into the millennial, um, uh, segment of the market as well. 03:52 They have very strong engagement with short form video, um, content and, and their kind of content discovery, uh, algorithms. Um, monetization challenges do exist, but they have been getting into things like TikTok shop and, and advertising and, and affiliates and stuff like that. 04:10 Um, and the last one I'll explore is Instagram. I mean, Instagram has an established user base. They have strong adoption. 04:18 Um, they have interconnectivity with Facebook. They have continued to evolve the platform with reels and shopping. Um, they're competing with TikTok and, and different e-commerce trends. 04:29 Um, and again, they're owned by Meta. So they have a lot of resources behind them. They have ad infrastructure, um, which, which is really in that ecosystem, uh, that Meta has, has developed. 04:40 Um, and so these three, um, social media platforms definitely are, uh, have a possibility to have long-term success. But, um, I think YouTube is best positioned for long-term success for the following reason. 04:55 So unlike TikTok, YouTube has a stable and proven revenue model that is supporting both the creators and the platform itself. 05:03 Um, YouTube's long-form and short-form video capabilities really allow the platform to adapt to different trends, um, while maintaining its core value. 05:13 of that long-form content that is so powerful. Next, Google's backing is really making sure that they're able to continue innovating. 05:23 Their recommendations are going to continue to get better and better. They have really strong search visibility and search capabilities, um, as well as infrastructure to handle the demand. 05:34 Um, and compared to Instagram, YouTube offers a lot a much more sustainable creator economy, and you need those creators to create a, a powerful content and social media platform. 05:46 So now I'm going to go a bit deeper, just explaining YouTube and, set up for the most success. So number one is their revenue and So they have an ad based model, first and foremost, most of the revenue is coming through They're the largest video ad platform out there and they have a ton of demand from 06:06 advertisers, whether they're big advertisers, huge companies or small businesses or small communities. Going into the Google ad network allows advertisers to use YouTube as another channel, um, to, to reach more customers. 06:21 The next part of their, their strategy is YouTube premium. So they continue to grow this subscription revenue stream, um, to reduce their reliance on ads and to create that more stable recurring revenue mechanism for the And creator monetization is also, um, an important aspect of their monetization 06:42 model. Um, revenue sharing, especially the amount of revenue that creators can earn on YouTube and the consistency of it. Of it as well really helps to keep them loyal to the platform. 06:53 A YouTube video has longevity. It's going to be watched for months and years to come. So the revenue will continue to come in for that creator. 07:02 Whereas TikTok or reels, these are more short form, um, uh, content platforms where the video is going to go away or it's going to be more difficult to have that longevity. 07:13 So revenue from one video is not going to have that long lasting nature to it, meaning it's not as attractive for creators to build content on the platform for. 07:24 The next is, um, YouTube's AI driven discovery and personalization. So they have a world class recommendation system that keeps users engaged for hours, keeps them watching these long form content. 07:37 Uh, videos for hours. Their integration with Google search also increases content discoverability. So because YouTube is owned by Google and, and Alphabet, the whole, uh, platform, they have really integrated Google, uh, YouTube videos into Google. 07:55 There are, is a specific search tab for it, but also when you're searching something on Google, a, a user can use Google So, are a So, with a lot of engagement and views for that search phrase is going to come up on that first page of results. So, Google, the biggest search platform in the world, is 08:13 funneling people straight into YouTube. And, we don't see that going away for a long time. While maintaining the long-form content as well. 08:29 So, you can, um, have the users graduate from that short-term content into the long-form content as well. The next piece here is YouTube has a very diverse content ecosystem. So, they support a lot more types of content, educational, entertainment, and professional as well. 08:49 as diverse of a content set as you'd find on YouTube. TikTok is all about short-form engaging content where users can watch one video and then move on to the next, where the next video is not really related. 09:03 Whereas, YouTube has really been built around specific niches and topics where people can go deep into a topic and watch a bunch of videos, um, in succession about it. 09:13 Additionally, um, YouTube has their live streaming capabilities, uh, in addition to TikTok, um, but they have, uh, a bit more stable infrastructure there so that, um, people can log on on the computer and watch these live streams as well. 09:29 Um, last, there are expanding into podcasts and music to solidify their dominance in terms of content overall. So, people can watch and go to YouTube, they can create or set a playlist to go and play, um, different genres of music as well. 09:45 The last piece here is their resilience to market shifts. So, unlike TikTok, it is not facing major regulatory threats in the United States. 09:55 TikTok was almost banned, it was banned for a period of time. YouTube, that's not a question, YouTube is owned by TikTok. 10:02 It's owned States companies, it's never been up for debate. No one is trying to ban YouTube or limit the access to YouTube, um, in their dominant markets. 10:13 Next, um, YouTube is competing across these multiple content formats, ensuring they can adapt to different trends that might pop up, like short-form, um, vertical videos. 10:25 And then last, Google. Google has immense resources that allow for that continuous innovation and stability. They are backed by, um, Google, which is a massive, massive company with tons of revenue and profits. 10:37 Um, whereas TikTok or Instagram and Facebook, they do have plenty of resources, but Google is just a behemoth of a, uh, a tech company. 10:46 So they'll always have those resources to continue innovating, continuing to continue testing, trying new things out, even if they don't work in the short term, they're not going to be a threat to YouTube staying around for the long, the long run. 10:58 So tying it back to the original question, because of their monetization model, their AI capabilities, their content ecosystem, and their resilience to these external threats, I believe that YouTube is the most likely social media platform to succeed in the long run. 11:14 So, as you've seen from this interview, uh, question and answer example, first, I started by exploring a couple different options. 11:23 So this, the top portion of the diamond, um, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. Then I chose YouTube and I justified it with a couple different vectors, and then I went deep into YouTube. 11:36 Now, um, I was able to prepare for this, uh, interview answer example, uh, because it's a recorded video. But, you won't have that time, necessarily, to, to prepare. 11:47 So, this could be a good moment to just pause and think, okay, what are two, three, or four different vectors that I can go into in my interview answer, um, and then I can talk about them, uh, in, in length. 11:59 So, you might spend 30 seconds before you're going to going deep to just say, okay, revenue, um, recommendations, their content types, and regulatory changes. 12:09 And then, from there, you can just dive in deep to each of these sections. So, that is the diamond method and how you could use it in your, in these type of open-ended, uh, interview questions. 12:23 So, hopefully, that helped to give you one more framework that you could potentially use. Uh, remember, you're exploring a couple different options, you're choosing one, and you're justifying, and then you're going deep on it, explaining a lot more about it.","Learn how to use the Diamond Method to structure open-ended PM interview answers so you can compare options, choose one, and defend it with a deep rationale.",fff17858-6105-4b2d-9bea-3da5a6d932c3,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Framework: Diamond Method,8,TRUE,13,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:21.627006+00
00cc14f718e34a3194e9549303442977,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over the listicle method. This is another framework that you can deploy in PM interviews to help you create and deliver a structured answer. 0:10 So, this framework is, uh, really helpful for more focused, open-ended questions. So, in certain interviews, you might be asked a more specific and focused, open-ended question. 0:21 A couple examples are as follows. Why do you think TikTok is so popular versus saying what social media platforms are popular? 0:29 What do you think factors into someone's decision to subscribe to a YouTube channel? This is open-ended, but specific to someone's decision to subscribe. 0:35 Or what has Netflix done poorly as they've tried to grow? These questions are about something tangible, something very focused and specific, but they you to explore different topics and angles. 0:51 So instead of the diamond method where you're exploring a bunch of different options and then going deep on one, you are presenting three different aspects of the specific question and answer that you're providing. 1:06 So it's possible that you could combine these frameworks, but this is just another way to answer this question. This type of question, the listicle method is inspired by the very popular listicle article format, which I'm sure you've come across. 1:20 So this is really popularized by Buzzfeed and other platforms like that, where there's an overall topic and then there's a list of aspects of that topic. 1:28 So they'll go one, two, three, et cetera, lists. The reason why this is popular is that lists are very easy for interviewers and anyone to really to follow along. 1:38 And that means the listicle method is also very easy to execute. So there's really three steps. You first briefly list out three different things or three different aspects of the, the interview answer. 1:51 You'll go through the list and explain each one in more detail, and then you'll summarize at the end. So I just wanted to provide a brief example without going through the the whole thing of how you can answer for that question. 2:03 Why is TikTok so popular? So you could start off by explaining the first three. So you could say, I think TikTok is very popular for three main reasons. 2:11 Number one, they're very authentic and short form video content. Number two, they're very powerful algorithm that powers the for you page. 2:20 And number three, they're focused on content discovery. So diving. And to number one, they're short form content. The way TikTok delivers short engaging content is kind of genius. 2:31 Think about it. Our attention spans are not what they used to be. People don't want to sit through long drawn out videos when they can get something fun, interesting, or even educational in as little as 15 to 60 seconds. 2:44 The way TikTok is designed, it makes it ridiculously easy to just keep. Thank you. Keep on watching. You finish one video and boom. 2:51 You swipe and the next video starts instantly, no loading, no waiting, no searching, no decision fatigue. They make it incredibly easy. 3:00 And that's one of the reasons why it's so popular. Next is number two. They're very powerful algorithm. It almost feels psychic and that's why users love it. 3:09 The second you start watching, TikTok is already figuring out your preference. So you, you know, I'm not going to go through the whole thing, but you see how we're starting with an overview. 3:18 And then you're naming and labeling that you're going to start on number one, the short form authentic content. And then next, number two, the powerful algorithm. 3:28 You're making it very easy for them to understand where are you in your answer. They're follow along. They have the biggest takeaway that, okay. 3:37 You've broken this thing down into, you know, two things or three things. This is helpful because in the role of a product, uh, being a product manager, you're going to be in meetings and presentations where you're trying to explain different concepts to a broader audience. 3:53 And if you can effectively explain an interview answer like this, they'll, and you'll instill confidence in them that you can. 4:01 And deliver a structured presentation or approach in the role, uh, that they're hiring you for. So hopefully this helps, um, understand the listical method as one other framework that you could deploy in your PM interviews. 4:14 And I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to use the listicle method to structure focused open-ended PM interview answers into three labeled points so you can communicate clearly and confidently.,2d845a8d-9daf-4df6-b21f-6c5ed72ce9f0,87022221-437b-4945-aee4-1fe4dea13c9e,Framework: Listicle Method,9,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:22.078719+00
f1258be6bd8f41be9c4416a0e09fe804,"00:00 Welcome to the art of product management offer negotiation, how to increase your total comp without losing out on your offer. 00:08 So in these lessons, I'm going to broadly go over how to understand your offer, how to effectively research and assess your market value, how to develop your product, how to develop the confidence and skills to advocate for yourself during the negotiation process, how to effectively communicate and demonstrate 00:31 the value of your skills and experience to justify the salary expectations that you set. And then finally, how to do all of this without jeopardizing the overall offer. 00:36 Opportunity. So in this first lesson, I'm going to go over understanding your offer at a base level. So there's really five different components that you need to be aware of. The base salary, the bonuses, the stock options and equity, the benefits and perks, and then finally the retirement contributions 00:48 . So. Base salary, this is the most straightforward component. This is what everyone is aware of. This is the fixed annual amount of money that you're paid to do this job. 00:57 It's often paid biweekly. And it's also the base used for bonus calculations in the future, like a performance bonus. Which leads us, to the bonuses. 01:05 And there are two. Sign-on bonus is a one-time payment that you may get when joining the company. This may typically be something like $5,000 or $10,000. 01:14 Sometimes I've heard bigger sign-on bonuses, but those are somewhat, um, uh, negotiable. We'll see you next time. But, uh, that's typically what I've found. 01:23 And then performance bonuses. This definitely varies company to company. I've actually never had a performance bonus, um, in any of the tech companies that I've worked at, but other companies do, um, have performance bonuses. 01:35 And this is a percentage. Is on your, your base salary. So for example, 15% performance bonus. If you reach a certain amount of success and performance throughout the year, and that's based on your base salary. 01:50 Um, and that may vary year to year, depending on how the company does. Depending on how you do. Um, next up is stock options and equity. 01:58 So this represents a piece of the company's future growth potential. And there are two main types here. There's incentive, stock options, um, typically referred to just as stock options, and then RSC. 02:10 Equity, in general, can be a pretty significant portion of tech compensation. Excuse me, in general, sometimes it could be, you know, half the value of your overall compensation is in stock. 02:23 So what is the difference between ISOs and RSU's? So ISO's, incentive stock options, these are the option to buy shares at a predetermined strike price. 02:34 Um, there's a lot of potential for significant gains if the company does really well with ISO's. So stock options are much more common for startups that are, you know, you know, very early and in the growth phase. 02:47 Whereas RSU's restricted stock units, those are typically seen for companies that are very mature and you know, potentially even are public already. 02:57 So RSU's are given in shares directly over time. Um, so instead of you having to buy them, they are just given to you directly. 03:06 It's less risky in general, but the potential rewards might be lower because the company is a lot more mature. So it's not like going from a very small startup to a growth stage company where you have 10x or 20x to the value. 03:19 Um, you know, the company is pretty mature at this point. So the gains aren't as significant. So next equity jargon demystified. 03:26 I'm going to go through several different terms and just explain what they mean. So vesting date. This is the specific date or time period when you're eligible to actually buy the stock that you've been granted at the beginning of you joining the company. 03:39 Before this vesting date, um, or this, you know, cliff date, which I'll go into later, uh, you're not actually able to buy the stocks. 03:46 Or receive them. Next is strike price or exercise price. This is specifically for incentive stock options or stock options. It's the predetermined price when at which you can buy the stock. 03:58 So for, for options, it's the price you pay to actually get the shares. Um, next is to exercise the stock. 04:05 So this is the act of actually purchasing the stock under the option agreement at that strike price. So you're using your option to buy the shares at this point when you exercise the stock. 04:17 Cliff Date, it's a, you know, set time before any of your stock options start vesting. It's like a waiting period and I'll go to that. 04:25 And the next slide, fair market value, that's described, uh, used to describe the current value of the stock at that point in time. 04:32 And this changes over time. Typically going up, um, as the company grows and continues to see success, the fair market value, the value of the stock will go up. 04:42 Expiration, so this is the last possible date by which you must exercise the stock options, otherwise you lose that ability to buy them. 04:50 And then finally, is the exit or liquidation event. So this is an event where a company actually is either sold or required or goes public. 04:58 And it's basically when your equity becomes, um, realized as cash or tradable stock. So you know, numbers on a screen, um, within your, your stock account to actually being able to sell the stock and receive, um, the value back in cash, um, which is, which is an exciting event for people who work within 05:19 tech. So in this slide, I'm going over, uh, basically, how you can view your in your stock options at different points in time. 05:28 So as you see this vesting schedule here, this is typically what it looks like, where you'll have a stock, you know, say 10,000 stock units or shares over four years, and then at the you one year mark, you're vesting. 05:41 Uh, there's a cliff and, uh, you'll receive 25% or sorry, the option to buy 25% at the one year mark. 05:48 And then maybe every single month you get a couple hundred more. Um, you're five, you're up to 5k, 7.5K. And then finally 10K at the end of the fourth year. 05:58 So let's look at the total value of your stock at two points in time, point A and point B. So in point A, say you've been at the company for 15 months, so little over a year. 06:10 That means you invested 3000 shares. And right now at the 15 month mark, the fair market value is $2.54. So that means the value of your stock. 06:21 How much is it worth? Is 3000 shares times the fair market value coming out to $620. Now your strike price, which remains the same throughout your time within the company, is 10 cents, which is really great. 06:36 So that means it only will cost $300 to buy the 3000 shares, which means that. The increase and the taxable kind of profit that you would get from your stock is seven is the total value 7,620 minus 300 is $7,320. 06:56 That's if you were, you know, if the company were to go public at this point. That's how much you'd be able to actually sell it for and make a profit and what you'd be taxed on as a profit. 07:16 Buy all those shares and the fair market value has increased significantly to now $13.89. So now the value is 10k shares times that fair market value coming out to almost $140,000. 07:30 This is where it's exciting. And the strike price, again, stays the same. It's only 10 cents. So to buy all those shares, it's only $1,000, which means the total increase in taxable profit of your stock is $138,900 minus that 1k. 07:50 So you can think of this now, this is a, you know, pretty big part of your overall compensation. This is over $100,000 of your stock that is gained in value. 08:01 So hopefully this helps you understand how kind of vesting works and the value of how your, the value of your stock can increase over time. 08:09 Uh, again, the fair market value is something to be aware of that should be going up over time as the company continues to gain success. 08:16 This strike price will stay the same, um, as when you start. Okay, now we're going beyond the basics, benefits and perks. 08:30 So, uh, health, dental, and vision insurance. Some companies will actually pay for 100% of your coverage here, which is really, really great. 08:37 You don't have to pay a premium and that's really awesome. Uh, next, paid time off and parental leave. So these are two, uh, different things that I've seen, unlimited PTO or flexible PTO. 08:48 Some companies will do, you know, 15 days or 20 days. Uh, but this is an additional. Benefit or perk, um, that you might want to be, you know, aware of when you're comparing different offers, uh, professional development allowances. 09:01 So the company may want, uh, may offer to pay for conferences, which, which are typically several thousand dollars. They may pay for online courses. 09:08 We'll be right back. We'll be right back. Which again are several thousand dollars. 09:11 Um, there's also additional industry perks like food in the office, lunch, dinner, um, transportation, uh, benefits, wellness benefits, like, you know, getting massages and all that. 09:23 Um, and then there's retirement funds. So, you know, make sure they offer a 401k so you can contribute to that. 09:29 Also, some companies will do a 401k match. So, they'll, for example, match 100% up to 6%. That is basically free money and you can count that as part of your overall compensation. 09:40 Okay, so now I'm going to run through three different example offers given a couple different types of companies. So this one is a Facebook Associate Product Manager offer in the New York City office. 09:52 The base salary is 110k, the sign-on bonus is a one-time 10k bonus and the equity that's given is RSU's 20k worth vested over four years. 10:04 So we're getting 25% each year. Additionally, there's a performance bonus and that's up to 15% of the base salary. Um, and $15,500 at max performance. 10:16 Couple of the perks. There's comprehensive health, dental vision. There's free meals, gym membership, transportation, extensive onboarding training and professional development. 10:25 Lots of additional perks with this Facebook offer. Um, so the first year total comp adding all this up is going to be $136,500 plus those perks. 10:35 That's the base, sorry, the base plus the bonus plus the stock given and then the performance. The next year, the following year, it actually be less a lower. 10:45 Salary because there's no longer that that sign on bonus. However, you might see a raise after the first year. So it may actually go up with your base salary and then your performance may go up as well. 10:58 Next, we have a startup offer. This is for an associate PM role in the New York City office. The base salary is 95k so a bit less than Facebook. 11:08 There's no sign on bonus because it's a startup. They don't have a lot of money. Um, the options are currently worth 25k at the current valuation. 11:15 No performance bonus. Um, some perks. Though there's flexible work hours. There's remote work days. There's a coworking space membership and there's health insurance, but the employee has to pay 50% of the premiums. 11:28 Um, so the first year in the following year, the total compensation is coming out to 95k. Plus the equity potential. 11:36 The equity potential right now does not seem a lot. So if you're just comparing this and Facebook, Facebook looks way better, but I'll get into the equity potential a bit later. 11:45 And then finally, we have square. Uh, this is an APM offer in the New York city office. The base is 105 K sign on bonus is five K equity, 15 K over four years. 11:56 And that's doing 25% each year. And there's also a performance bonus up to 10% of the base salary. Um, in terms of perks, there's a hundred percent health and dental. 12:06 Uh, insurance, the employee does pay, uh, 20% of the dental insurance, there's commuter benefits, there's a monthly wellness stipend, and then there's a professional development fund. 12:16 So your first year total comp is going to come out to 120 K whereas the following year will be one 15. 12:22 Okay. So now, um, let's look at comparing these three offers. Say you get all these three offers and you're like, what should I do? 12:29 Let's go through pros and cons of each. So I, I represented this in a way to show a large tech company versus a large tech company. This is an early stage startup versus a mid sized company. 12:42 Um, so let's start with Facebook pros highest based salary and total comp. There's a lot of health benefits, free meals, perks like that and opportunity for networking and growth and a huge tech company. 12:53 Cons, though. Potentially very high competition and work pressure because you're at you're at a fang company. There's less flexibility in terms of work hours compared to the startup. 13:03 Um, now let's go to the startup. The a huge pro is the equity with a massive upside potential. There's a lot more flexibility with with where you know, work hours and remote days. 13:15 Um, and there's also, you know, the option to join this co working space and work from different locations. Um, but some cons it is the lowest base salary by a lot. 13:25 There's no sign on bonus or performance. Um, you have to pay for health insurance. There's obviously the major risk that the startup is in a fail or change directions. 13:35 And you might miss out on that equity upside. Now we have Square. This is the mid-sized tech company. So it's a pretty competitive base salary. 13:42 There's a. Good sign on bonus. Um, and there's a balance between kind of this structured corporate environment. And also a bit of the, uh, kind of startup flexibility. 13:52 Um, there's a wellness stipend as well and professional development funds on the con side though. Um, you have to. Pay for part of the health insurance and it might not have as, um, the same brand recognition as Facebook or the equity of an early stage, uh, startup. 14:08 So these are all things to consider, um, when you're evaluating these offers and you're going to have to figure out what is going to be most. 14:15 Important for you. Um, and, uh, in doing so you're going to hopefully ultimately end up at the right place, um, that's benefiting you in, you know, a financial sense. 14:27 So it's, it's helping you to, you know, grow your finances. Um, and it's all. Also really helping you have peace of mind. 14:35 Um, you don't want to be in an environment where you feel stressed out. Um, you want to be in a company that you're excited to work at. 14:41 It's compensating you well and you're happy to be there. So hopefully this helped you just understand the baseline of how these are. 14:47 The offers are typically structured and how to kind of evaluate pros and cons of each offer. Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson which is around researching the market.","Learn how to break down and compare job offers across salary, bonuses, equity, benefits, and retirement so you can evaluate total compensation and choose the best offer.",087823a8-cbf0-49ba-b4d9-b26bcae4b7a8,f0ba4633-0e95-4c73-a54e-8a2f742edb10,Understanding your offer,1,TRUE,15,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:25.094219+00
6fb3247616eb4072bd24b3bffd6cc443,"00:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over researching the market and trying to understand your offer a little bit better. 00:06 So one of the most important things that you can do is understand the different stages that your company may be in. 00:12 So here are the different ways that a company can basically be. This is as early as it gets. This is individuals or a very, very small team of founders. 00:25 They have a vision for a new product or service. They're usually in the process of forming a business plan, conducting market research. 00:32 Or building an initial prototype. They may seek small amounts of funding from family and friends or just personal savings. This is very, very early. 00:40 Now we have seed stage. So we have a more concrete idea as a company. We may have developed a prototype or an MVP and we're usually at this stage seeking funding from angel investors or early stage venture capitalists to really further develop and test this product, hire a team and enter the market 00:58 . It's pretty rare that you'd be brought in at this stage, especially as an early product manager. But it's definitely not unheard of for PMs to be brought in, but it's more so common that the team would focus on hiring engineers and then once they start to see traction and they really need 01:15 to scale, that's when they'll bring in a product manager. Early stage is series A, so this is the next one. 01:21 This is where a company will have a market tested product, there's some traction and some revenue coming, they're seeking a series A to really start to scale their product, expand their team and further grow their user base. 01:33 Okay, now we're doing well as a company, we're injecting fuel into it. And we're in a growth stage, this is series B and C. 01:40 We have pretty significant traction at this point, we have a good strong product market fit, our revenue is growing, we're expanding our offerings, and we're seeking B and C funding to scale our operations. 01:53 We want to expand into new markets, we want to really, really refine the product. Okay, now we're doing really well, we've grown a ton, we're a late stage startup. 02:03 Now, we're series D and beyond, so these companies have reached a very high level of maturity in revenue. You know, we're doing, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue per year or, or even more. 02:16 They seek late stage funding to further expand their market reach, maybe they're going international, they'll improve their product offerings or expand, and then they're gonna start to prepare for an IPO or an acquisition by a much larger company. 02:29 Now you're pre IPO. So you're preparing for an IPO, you're doing a lot of, you know, audits and making sure everything is looking good. 02:37 They may conduct a final round of funding known as like a bridge round to bolster their finances and support the IPO process, which could be very expensive to make sure it's ready for the market. 02:47 And then finally publicly traded the, they've gone through an IPO, an initial public offering. So they ring the bell on the stock exchange. 02:55 And now they're listed. They have a stock ticker. They're typically very mature, established companies, a broad user base, and really substantial revenue that's consistent and growing over time. 03:06 And they're continuing to seek growth through product innovation, market expansion, and different acquisitions. So next, this chart will just show you the potential upside as it relates to what, you know, when you actually join a startup and the risk associated. 03:24 So all the way on the right. This is when you're starting a company. So extremely high risk. However, if it does well, there's a massive potential for upside. 03:35 This is tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of upside. If you're able to found, you know, found and start your own startup. 03:43 However, it's extremely risky. The amount, the amount. Of the, you know, percentage of startups that fail you know, before they even get to this point is very, very high. 03:53 So there's, there's pros and cons. Now, as you go along, as you know, you go seed and then series a you're decreasing your risk. 04:01 However, the. I'll see you next time. Upside is going lower and lower. Now, series a, there's still a huge upside. 04:08 It's just not in the realm of, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars. Especially if you're joining as you know, a product manager, not a founder and you're getting less than, you know, half a percent or, you know, less than 0.1% of the company. 04:24 The, the upside is going down. However, it still could be hundreds of thousands, if not a couple million dollars at this point. 04:31 And then as you go further along, the risk is decreasing. Crea- which means there's much, much, much more likely of a chance that the company's going to go, you know, be acquired or go public. 04:43 And you're actually gonna be able to cash out on the equity. But the upside is, is decreasing over time. So let's just give an exam. 04:50 So for example, of what this looks like the sliding scale of base salary versus equity. And we're comparing a seed stage company and offer with a big tech offer. 05:00 So the base salary, for example, you might be 80k less than within a seed stage company. And this is because the seed stage company does not have a lot of money to actually spend on the staff. 05:14 It's all in the equity. So you're paying 80k less than what you would expect to make at a big tech company for the same role. 05:21 But equity percentage. Within the big tech company, you have an extremely small percentage of the overall company. You may have 0.00001% versus you may be brought in as a product manager at a seed stage, seed stage company at 1%. 05:39 Or one and a half percent. This is massively much bigger than a big tech company and a founder for just to, for comparison, the founder may have 30% or 40% depending on if there's multiple founders, there may be 20% in the next video. 05:55 Thanks for watching! As you can see and imagine, 1% versus 20%, that's why people become founders, because they're going to make 20x the amount they would make as opposed to joining as an individual contributor higher later in the year. 06:11 Okay, so the equity value now between a seed stage company and a big tech company is completely in favor of the big tech company. 06:22 Right now it's 240k, it's probably going to remain the same. Go up slightly if the company is doing well which is, you know, a great additional aspect of your compensation. 06:34 This is real money. This is a lot of money and you're getting it over four years versus right now the seed stage companies equity is worth 10k. 06:43 We haven't really launched or seen a lot of major success. We've just released the MVP. There's really no value yet that's been generated. 06:52 So it's very, very low. However, what is the value look later of our equity between a seed stage and a big tech. 07:00 So ultimately that equity may have gone up a little bit and it's coming out at around 75k per year. But the equity of this seed stage company in the chance that it did really, really well and actually found product market fit and increase. 07:28 This is the stories you hear of people who joined startups and then literally retire after just working at this startup because the value of their stock is increased so significantly and when looking at the base salary 120k it doesn't even matter that you were missing out on the 80k at this point because 07:47 of how much you then earned with the equity value later. And it's just worth noting that this is most likely not going to happen because the failure rate of these seed stage startups is very, very high. 08:03 So be wary of, you know, very early stage companies, especially ones that don't have a lot of traction yet. Because this seems appealing. 08:11 However, it's very unlikely to happen. So some people may opt for the more conservative path where they're going to get a consistent 75 K extra per year in compensation. 08:20 Which is really, really great. So where do you actually do research to find out all these values? I would say there's a couple main two sources and then Google and Blind are auxiliary but Glassdoor is is a great resource for tons of salary information. 08:38 I would say levels.fyi is really good as well and I'll just go there quickly. You can see, you know, you can search by company and you can really see a lot into the actual company. 08:50 So let's go to Stripe for example. Stripe is a you know, payment processing company. They have several different levels of product manager and as you can see, they pay really, really well. 09:04 So their base salary is 170k for an L2 product manager. They give 77k in stock per year and also a big bonus. 09:13 When you get promoted to an L3, your stock, your total comp goes up to $456,000 per year where it's almost, you know, half of your compensation is stock. 09:24 So. This is really, really great to just start to see other people's salary and their total compensation. You can, you know, click the buttons to be able to view more detail. 09:35 And then this, this view actually gives you very granular information about the offers people have received. So for example, this person, they, you know, accepted this offer very, you know, recently when I'm recording this a couple months ago in August of 2023, they've had seven total 09:55 years experience and then three at the company. And they're an L for product manager making $810,000 a year. That is really crazy. 10:04 That's a ton of money. And, and it's very competitive to get a job at Stripe, but you can see why it's because the pay is, is, is really, really strong. 10:13 So that's where to do research. In the next lesson, I'm going to go over making the actual ask when it comes to negotiating your overall offer. 10:21 All right. See you there.",Learn how to evaluate startup stages and compensation tradeoffs using salary and equity research so you can choose offers that match your risk and earning goals.,13eca6aa-0d33-42bb-86e2-64d5e7fa5aad,f0ba4633-0e95-4c73-a54e-8a2f742edb10,Researching the market,2,TRUE,11,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:25.507176+00
53aa8c213a504fe9abc6611e3f5b8561,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over making the ask when you get the offer. So congrats, you've gotten an offer at this point. 00:07 This is super exciting, but what is actually next? So there's going to be a recruiter call. They'll most likely send you an email along the lines of Anthony, I have some news I'd like to share with you. 00:18 Are you free today or tomorrow for a quick phone call? This likely means that you're getting an offer over the call and they'll explain the compensation package there. 00:26 So agree to chat with them as soon as possible given your schedule. But first things first, let's step back and recognize where we are at right now. 00:35 Getting an offer in today's market is not easy, especially if you're transitioning in from another field. So you should feel incredibly accomplished of yourself. 00:43 Recognize that they are giving you a six figure offer because they believe your skills will benefit their customers. They believe in your capabilities and so should you. 00:52 This is an incredibly exciting moment in time. You have some leverage, you have some momentum behind you. But this fear holds people back from negotiating and they miss out on tens of thousands of dollars over the course of their careers when they don't negotiate. 01:28 And to add on top of this, offers are created with negotiations in mind. They are waiting for you to actually negotiate. 01:35 So to take a step back, how do they come up? With the offer in the first place. So companies have what is called pay bands or salary bands, or some other similar term. 01:43 It's a basically a range of compensation that the company has come up with for that role. So the employees who have that title all ideally fall within that range. 01:53 And sometimes that range is not made public, sometimes it is like in New York but companies will pick a number typically between like the 50th and 75th percentile on that band, leaving plenty of room to increase the offered based on negotiation. 02:09 So, the offer based on a pay band. Imagine the company you've applied to has a band for their APM position of 110 to 130k. 02:19 This may be what they're, you know, putting publicly or just internally. So, they may start off the offer at 120 right in the middle of the month. The 50th percentile of the band. 02:28 This means that if you ask for a higher salary they do have wiggle room to increase your salary to close you. 02:34 Because remember, they want you. They didn't choose someone else. They chose you because of your background. The way you answer the questions. 02:41 Questions. The way you connected with the team. So you do have leverage here. So, when you're on the call with the recruiter, they're going to explain the offer and express that they're really excited to have you join the team. 02:52 At this point in the process, the recruiter wants to close you as the hire for this position. And. There will have been other candidates that have come through the pipeline. 03:01 They're basically graded on how many candidates that they can actually hire. So it's their incentive to actually close you as a candidate and, you know, a competitive product management candidate might get multiple offers. 03:12 And so they're going to do everything in their power to make sure. They close you and not lose you out to another company because then the, you know, hiring team has to start from scratch or go with the candidate they weren't as excited about. 03:23 So don't let this intimidate you. Take your time with it. And during the call, you're going to want to ask any and all questions. 03:30 You have about the offer. Encourage them to explain things if you don't understand them or like it's if it's your first time hearing something. 03:37 It's really important that you just understand your offer so that you can know what to negotiate later on. Tell them that you are super excited about the offer. 03:46 That it remains your top choice in your search and just request that they send the compensation package over email so you can take time to review it and read through everything. 03:56 So thank you so much for this offer. You know, this is what you could say. I'm super excited about the opportunity to join your team. 04:02 After meeting everyone and learning more about the role in the company, it seems like an awesome fit. I would like to take some time to think over the offer after reviewing all the materials. 04:12 Would you be able to send those over email today? And then they'll probably say yes, of course. And then, okay, awesome. 04:18 Look forward to reviewing everything and getting back to you soon. I appreciate all your work, by the way, throughout this entire interviewing process. 04:25 You've really helped to create a seamless experience and I can't say the same for other companies that I've been interviewing at. 04:31 Then after the call, you're gonna want to send an email to the recruiter. After they send you the offer materials. 04:38 So here are a couple different examples of the scripts that you can use within different scenarios. So this, you know, at this point we're, you know after receiving the email, um, we're gonna go ahead and send an email to the recruiter. Um, and you're gonna respond, I appreciate 04:55 you sending over the form of offer. I'm excited about the opportunity to join Airbnb and contribute to the search team. I would like to take a few days to thoroughly review the details and think over the decision. I'll get back to you. Bye. And then give them a date. Usually within a week is reasonable 05:13 for you to review everything. So now you've got the offer. This is super exciting. Um, you're probably excited about the salary as it is, but you're gonna want to research the market and come up with a counter offer. 05:21 So review the lessons in this course in the previous lessons to really understand what your offer is comprised of and how it might compare to others. 05:29 Try to understand what it means today versus what it means four years down the line after you stay there for several years and your stock has vested in its grown and determine if the benefits fit your needs and if you'll be happy with this offer, you know, the health insurance is really important. 05:44 The paid family leave is really important. Those things are very important. And now you're going to come up with your counter offer. 05:50 So what you're going to do is you're going to go to the PM offer negotiation calculator. You're going to go to the PM offer negotiation calculator. You go to file, make a copy, and this is where you're going to put in information in the blue. 06:01 So you're going to put in your initial salary, let's say $130,000 as your base salary. Then you're going to put in the number of shares that you were given act you know. 06:11 Access to. So let's say $5,000. And you're going to put in your exercise price if it's stock options of, you know, $1. 06:19 And the current value of the stock is $10. So you can see that this total comp per year is coming out to $141. 06:27 $1,000 at the current value of the stock. But imagine if the company continues to do well, and it 10 X's in revenue and valuation. 06:35 That means that even though you have, you're making a hundred, you know, 41,000 right now, which is extremely good. The value of your equity increases a lot. 06:46 That means your, your total comp per year goes up to over a quarter million dollars, $253,000 per year. So what does this mean in terms of the negotiation? 06:57 So down below, I have different tiers here, low, medium, high, for what you can counter offer for your base salary and then the equity. 07:06 These are based on percentiles. So this is a 7% increase above what you were given 12 and then 15%. So as you're going along, use your discretion and, and do what you, what feels comfortable. 07:20 I recommend, you know, at least asking for this low counter offer. But, you know, depending on the vibe, depending on, you know, if they seem extremely excited about you, if they're moving very quickly. 07:32 If you have a really strong four vector fit and, and you have a ton of great experience, you might you know, ask for something a bit higher. 07:40 You know, feel free to ask for any advice with, within this negotiation. But for example, if you see here, the base is 130. 07:49 The low is 139. I would go back and I would ask, you know, within the email, I would come down here and I would write this email out. 08:00 So just to set some context here, you've decided you would like to negotiate for a higher salary. You need to clearly articulate your value, support the counter offer with market research and express gratitude. 08:12 So this is the type of email that I might send to the recruiter after I've taken a couple days to do this research to evaluate things and send something back. 08:20 Hey, you know, Jane, I hope you're well. I've spent some time over the last couple of days reviewing the offer and assessing its alignment with my career goals and background. 08:29 Speaking with everyone during the interview process has shown me that Airbnb is well positioned to continue to make a huge impact on the world. 08:36 Role specifically aligns well with my background, my interest and interest in the travel space, and there's seems to be a lot of awesome challenges and opportunities ahead. 08:45 The one aspect of the offer I've been thinking over is compensation. I'm wondering if there's any flexibility to move to a, and this is where you put it. 08:52 I've had an $140,000 base salary and depending on if you want to increase your stock you know, 5,350 incentive ISOs based on my research and the value that I bring to the table, especially with my experience within the travel industry. 09:09 And the marketing team, this compensation will be more in line with what I'd be looking for this role. I'm really excited about the opportunity to be happy to sign today if you're able to move in that direction. 09:18 Happy to discuss further over the phone if that's easiest for you. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you. 09:25 It's quite powerful. I've had this, I've used this several times and it's worked several times. You know, they say, okay, if you're willing to sign today, we're happy to do that. 09:34 And then you do have to follow through with signing today after you've said that. When, when you're doing all this, remember that the tech world is it's big, but it's still small. 09:43 There's a lot of, you know, common people who have a lot of connections and you don't want to, you know, really get sneaky or try to manipulate these companies in any way. 09:54 You want to be authentic and, and. Stick to your word. So if you say this line, it is very effective at working, but that means that you do have to actually sign when they give the offer, if it's, if it's within the realm. 10:09 Okay. So that was basically different ways that you can approach and actually make the ask. Again, use this guide and the scripts here to copy and paste, fill in the numbers, use the offer calculator, play around you know, these values are hard coded, so 7%, but fill in the description. 10:29 So, feel free to play around with these numbers. You can, you know, change these percentages, maybe you want the low end to be 5%, and then 10%, and then 12%, just to help you get a better understanding, but these are the types of numbers that I would probably recommend you know, and it varies 10:46 based on a bunch of different factors, but hopefully you can use these scripts within your process of making the ask and, and in emailing back, and then hopefully you'll be able to get the, the increase that you so deserve. 11:00 Alright, I will see you in the next lesson. Or I'm going to go over different tips that you can deploy during the negotiation process. 11:06 See you there.",Learn how to request and negotiate a higher compensation package after receiving a job offer so you can secure better pay and equity.,0f697f74-7686-41ea-b635-9a4c1b30c608,f0ba4633-0e95-4c73-a54e-8a2f742edb10,Making the ask,3,TRUE,12,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:25.938023+00
6f18b838bf824ec5a46e5059ff346c39,"0:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over different tips that you can deploy during the negotiation process. Number one, know your worth. 0:07 Really research the current averages for compensation packages for the role that you get an offer for. It may be actually very shocking how much of a pay bump that you'll be getting. 0:16 Getting transitioning into a product management role, but just know that this is what product folks are actually compensated with. You know, it's, it, it might come as a surprise that it is okay to get a 10K increase from the base salary that you were given. 0:32 So in your previous role, you might be negotiating within the realm of a couple thousand dollars. So know your worth, do research, really understand what are people really paid for for these PM positions. 0:43 Focus on your value. So remember that you specifically are bringing value to the team they're hiring for. It's likely something in your background, whether you have a strong four-market, four-vector fit. 0:54 You have the right type of skill set for the role, the right industry knowledge. Make sure you emphasize this during the negotiation process. 1:01 They gave you the offer for a reason, it wasn't just randomly picked out of the hat. There are specific reasons they gave this offer to you and not to other people within the interview round. 1:12 Additionally, be open to compromise. So it's unlikely companies will give exactly what you ask for, especially in this current market. 1:19 If you're offered 115, and you ask 125, they may give you 122. That is great. That's a great $7,000 increase and you should be super excited about it. 1:29 An extra $600 a month in salary is nothing to snuff at. You know, for me, I would view that as a lot more, you know, chicken parm. 1:38 It's a ton extra per month. So be open to compromise, you know, whatever they do give you. If you're excited about the company and you don't have any offers, you should be excited, excited about accepting that, that increase. 1:51 You know, also know that they have rules. About how much flexibility they have, it'll be unlikely they'll have to compromise in the middle, rather than giving exactly what you want. 2:00 That's completely normal and okay. You know, they're obviously not going to go outside of the band. So that there's pay like inequity within the company, within the role. 2:08 So there's different. Different rules that they have to you know, comply by. Also try to do everything in writing. It's a lot easier to communicate yourself in an eloquent and straightforward way over written communication that you can edit and go back and forth and iterate, check spelling and 2:23 grammar and everything compared to verbal communication. Where if you're not really experienced as a negotiator and you don't have a lot of confidence, you may come off not, you know, you may come off more nervous and, and not really straightforward and stumble and not communicate your value 2:39 . So to compensate for this, just try to do everything over email, it's gonna work out better for you in the end. 2:45 Also, be prepared to walk away from an offer. If an offer comes in a lot lower than you originally thought, be prepared to walk away from it during the negotiation process. 2:55 Ultimately, you want to accept an offer that you're really excited about. You'll feel fairly compensated for in the role, and during the negotiation process, it's very unlikely that they would pull an offer from you, but either way, be prepared to turn it down. 3:10 It's just like in relationships. Just because someone expresses interest in you. Doesn't mean you have to marry them. Additionally, you're not going to annoy a recruiter or hiring manager when negotiating. 3:21 This is common to see people get nervous that they're going to annoy the recruiter. They're going to annoy the hiring manager and get in the way and have them regret giving them an offer. 3:30 They're worried it'll be awkward when they start the role, but this is all in your head. As mentioned, recruiter and hiring managers expect people to negotiate. 3:38 In fact, they almost negotiated themselves. Or sorry, almost definitely negotiated themselves. It's so common that it can be viewed as almost weird. 3:46 If someone doesn't negotiate that doesn't mean you have to negotiate, especially in the current market. But what I will tell you is that almost everyone negotiates their offers and they almost always get an increase within the base salary or the equity portion. 4:02 Don't negotiate too aggressively. Remember to be grateful for the offer throughout the process. As with anything, don't come off as aggressive when communicating with the company. 4:12 Make your case of why you believe you deserve a higher comp package, but don't be short or talk down to the recruiting or higher manager. 4:19 Another thing is don't ask for like 30k above the base salary or 20k. You know, it should be re- and that depends on what you know you were given, but be reasonable. 4:30 Don't, don't come off as too aggressive when you're communicating with the company. Then the next one I just covered this, but don't go too high. 4:38 There are reasonable counter offers and then there are unreasonable and you can typically tell this with a gut feeling. Like if it feels too high, you may be right that you're asking too much and you should bring it down a notch. 4:50 So when you reach out, feel free to reach out to me for advice here. And an example of this is, you know, you might get an offer at 110 and your counter offer is 140. 4:59 That is a 30% increase from the offer you gave, which is pretty unreasonable to expect because Because that's what we're talking about. That's even more than you might experience within an actual promotion to the level above. 5:12 So definitely, you know, think through this and don't go too high with your counter offer. Additionally, don't base the counter offer on anything other than your skills. 5:21 It's common that candidates will cite like cost of living, for example, in their ass. So they'll say like, oh, because I, you know, live in New York City, I should get more. 5:29 This devalues the ask over all. They will already have taken this into account like where your cost of living and where you're living. 5:37 It's not a reason to increase your comp. Package, but by restating your overall value and skill set that you bring to the team is a reason to actually get an increase. 5:48 So just as a reminder, you got this. I believe in you. I think you'll, you'll be able to get a great increase on. 5:55 Your, your overall great salary that you have already achieved, but when in doubt, feel free to drop a comment and then ask me any questions you have and we can collaborate on this. 6:04 All right. Good luck.","Learn how to negotiate a job offer by researching market pay, communicating your value in writing, and setting reasonable counters so you can secure fair compensation confidently.",ea9028c2-5afa-4150-a1c0-b4b7d5723713,f0ba4633-0e95-4c73-a54e-8a2f742edb10,Tips during Negotiations,4,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:07:26.361165+00
d03c8d698f604af1bb37f535aa6c59df,"00:01 Hey, everyone, and welcome to the PM Playbook. In this course, we're going to go through everything you need to know about mastering product management concepts. 00:10 So let's dive right in. The first module here is going to be an intro to product management. We're going to go over the basics in this module. 00:17 And the first lesson lesson 1.1 is about the role and responsibilities of a product manager. Okay, so I want to welcome you to this first lesson. 00:27 In this lesson, we're going to dive deep into what are the actual responsibilities of a product manager. What do they need to do to be successful in their role? 00:37 And by the end of this lesson, you're going to have a good understanding of how PMs contribute to the success of an organization. 00:44 PMs are a critical component of any tech company. They're really the glue between multiple different jobs, you know, functions within a company, whether it's the business side, the tech side, marketing, et cetera. 00:57 They are really in the center of the all. And by the end of this lesson, you'll have a good understanding of really what they eventually do in their role. 01:06 Okay, so to jump into the role of APM, I put a definition here. So it's a professional who guides product development, launch an ongoing success in a market. 01:17 They're really the central hub. Again, this like glue that works closely with many different teams. It's engineering primarily designed. So designing the product, how it looks and fields, marketing how are we marketing this product to users, how are we getting it out into the world and other teams like 01:36 the legal team, the sales team, the customer support team, really focused on ensuring that the ultimate product is delivering value to customers and it aligns to our overall business strategy. 01:48 The PM is the one that really is taking a ton of different inputs all around the company from different stakeholders and working with everyone to really deliver a product that excites users, it solves their pain points, and it's also making money and growing over time, which is ultimately the goal of 02:07 most businesses. So as a PM, the primary functions are going to include first and foremost defining and communicating a product vision and strategy. 02:16 Second is really researching and getting deep into understanding what do our users actually need. What are the problems that they face and what can we do to accomplish that? 02:27 The third plays into that. So prioritizing features and initiatives based on business value and customer impact. So we want to pick features to work on that not only solve user problems but also are good for the business. 02:41 They earn the business more revenue, they keep users more retained, etc. Number four is guiding the team and the product through its entire life cycle. 02:50 So, from inception to launch and beyond, the fifth is making sure that you're analyzing data and making data-driven decisions to improve the product. 03:00 Data is an enormous part of the PM function. The PM is really responsible for trying to figure out what data we can get about the product and how we can use it to actually make smart decisions. 03:12 And then finally, number six is collaborating with and managing stakeholders across the organization. The PM, again, is the centerpiece of a bunch of different teams. 03:23 So they need to be sure, make sure that they are collaborating with, communicating with et cetera, many different stakeholders, whether it's someone in marketing, whether it's a legal team, whether it is the head of sales, whether it's customer support representatives or the head of customer support, 03:40 there's a lot of different people that the PMs actually engage with to ensure that their needs are met internally. and we're solving the right problems for users. 03:51 Okay, so to dive in here, I'm going to show you just an example about what a PM isn't gonna be doing, and in this scenario, we're focused on Airbnb. 04:01 So let's assume for this example that you are the PM responsible for the search experience on Airbnb. So here's kind of an example of end-to-end what your role may be and what your primary functions are gonna be as the PM of search on Airbnb. 04:19 So, number one, defining and communicating a product, vision, and strategy. So you're gonna develop a clear vision for what the search experience should be. 04:29 And this vision should align with Airbnb's mission. That mission being we wanna create a world where anyone can belong anywhere by providing unique local and authentic travel experiences. 04:42 So your vision for the search team should map to that higher level mission that Airbnb has. You're going to communicate this vision to a bunch of different stakeholders, the engineers, the design team, the data team, marketing teams, and you want to make sure that everyone understands what is the purpose 05:00 of our team, what are our objectives, and make sure they're aligned on that as well. Number two is in a researching and understanding the customer needs. 05:09 So you're going to want to conduct user research through surveys, interviews, focus groups, etc. to really understand the pain point for both guests and hosts when it comes to searching for listing accommodations. 05:22 You really want to understand at a deep, deep level what are their pain points? What are they having trouble doing? 05:28 Where are their gaps right now in the product experience where we could build something specifically for them? You're going to analyze data to identify trends, user behavior patterns, and areas of improvement. 05:39 So you really want to you, as the search PM on Airbnb, get to know the pain points of users who are trying to search for accommodations. 05:49 Number three, you're going to prioritize features and initiatives based on business value and customer impact. So based on that user research and data analysis that you just did in the previous step, you're going to work on identifying features and improvements that would really make the search experience 06:05 that much better. Here, an example of a couple options here, personalized recommendations. So maybe you set your preferences at the beginning, or they know we know, as Airbnb, your past booking experiences and options. 06:21 So we're going to provide recommendations for you. Another could be better filtering options, or a map-based search. You're going to want to prioritize all these features based on multiple different factors, like the impact on user satisfaction, the booking conversion rate, the business value, the effort 06:37 , we're going to go into a lot of this in later lessons. Number four, guiding the product through its entire life cycle from inception to launch and beyond. 06:46 So you are going to work very, very closely with the engineers on your team as well as the designer or multiple designers. 06:53 And you're going to really create detailed requirements, wireframes and mockups for these prioritized features. You're never going to do this alone, so you're always going to have engineers and designers that you're working with to ultimately ship these features. 07:08 But you are going to oversee this development, testing and iteration of the features. You want to make sure that the features that the team is actually shipping are solving user problems and that they're good for the business. 07:22 So you're going to plan and execute the launch of an updated search experience. for example coordinating with the marketing and customer support teams to ensure that when you actually do launch it there's a smooth rollout and the customers are not running into any issues with it. 07:37 Okay so number five you're gonna want to monitor key performance indicators, KPIs. This is data. Search to booking conversion rates so that is how many people start searching and then actually book. 07:51 Is it 10% is it 20% we're gonna want to know that KPI number and we're going to want to improve that over time. 07:58 User engagement, customer satisfaction, or a couple more examples. You're gonna wanna analyze all this data to identify different areas in the search experience that can be optimized. 08:08 So you're gonna see different parts of the process have different metrics associated. And if there's ones that aren't performing as well, you're gonna know that that's an area of opportunity. 08:20 You may also conduct AB tests to validate different hypotheses policies that you have and make data-driven decisions on which to implant. 08:27 An AB test and we'll go over this later is when you show one experience to a group 50% of users and another experience to the other 50% of users. 08:37 And you're seeing which one performs better based on these KPIs that you set. So for example, the search to booking conversion rate, where again, that's how many people land on search and start searching, then actually book. 08:50 So you may do 100 users in one group with one search experience and 100 users in the other group And you might see that in group B that 40 people actually book but in group A only 20 people book and so from that data You'll know that group B that experience that second experience is actually a lot better 09:12 than group Then the first a experience and and so what you're gonna do is then you're gonna roll that second experience out to 100% of users. 09:21 That way Airbnb is going to greatly benefit from the more users that are actually booking through this search experience. Number six, collaborating with managing and with and managing stakeholders. 09:34 So this again is extremely important. You want to maintain open communication with many different teams at Airbnb ensuring that they're aligned with the vision and strategy for the search experience that you've created. 09:46 You're going to want to manage their expectations and address concerns. You know, different stakeholders from across Airbnb are likely going to want a lot from you because you're responsible for search. 09:57 And you really want to manage their expectations because you don't have unlimited resources to do everything imaginable. And so you may not be able to accomplish something that they would like. 10:07 You need to manage their expectations here. Another thing here is regularly presenting updates on the progress and performance of search to see your leadership and you want to showcase the impact of your team's work and advocate for additional resources to support future improvements. 10:24 So this is really going at you want to when you're doing work on your team and when you're having success actually communicate that and tell tell the rest of the organization what your team is doing how it's actually impacting Airbnb at the end of the day. 10:39 Okay, so by following these steps as a PM for Airbnb. You'd be driving the development and improvement of a very key part of the platform. 10:49 PMs can have a significant impact on user satisfaction, business performance, and the overall success of the product. So I hope that was an exciting good example to demonstrate what a PM really is responsible for, and now we're going to dive in a little bit deeper. 11:05 So strategy and planning. As a PM, you're going to be responsible for first and foremost, developing a vision and roadmap that aligns with your organization's goals. 11:15 So maybe in a specific quarter, Airbnb or the organization you have, your in has a specific goal. And you want to make sure that your vision and roadmap actually aligns to that goal. 11:26 You're supporting the larger business initiatives. You're going to set measurable objectives and key results. OK, ours is typically how communicated to track your progress. 11:36 And you're going to want to prioritize features and initiatives to maximize the impact on the customers of your product and the business. 11:44 Number two, execution. In this phase, you're going to be responsible for really day-to-day working with the engineers to plan out and develop these product features. 11:54 You're going to also manage the backlog, so that's all the things that the team wants to do in a prioritized order. 12:01 And you're You're going to coordinate when we work on these and when we release them. You're going to monitor progress of all the work that's happening and you're going to make sure that we deliver features on time to our users. 12:15 During this process, you're going to really closely collaborate with the UX and UI designers to create really user-friendly and visually appealing products. 12:24 In 2023, people come to expect really clean, seamless, easy to understand products, so you're want to partner really closely with these specialists to design great experiences for your end users. 12:37 Number three here, measurement and improvement. So to ensure that you're continuously improving over time, you're going to want to first define and track these KPIs to measure your product's success. 12:48 You want to know what are the biggest levers we have to pull for our product area? And how can we actually measure those? 12:56 What is the baseline that we're even working off of. The next is analyzing this data. We're going to dive deep into the data to understand, like, where are there areas for opportunity? 13:07 Where can we actually improve? You're also going to leverage customer feedback at this phase. A lot of people at a big company like Airbnb are going to be writing in, telling the product manager and the teams what they want changed about the search experience. 13:21 So you can use that data as an input here. And then third, you want to iterate on the product based on these data insights and user feedback, ultimately resulting in a more optimized product experience. 13:34 Stakeholder management. So, effective stakeholder management is extremely important for product managers. You're going to want to communicate the vision that your team has come up with, what the strategy is, and you're going to want to do this primarily to internal teams and sometimes external partners 13:51 as well. So, if you're working on a team that has a lot of integrations. We'll go into integrations in a later lesson. 13:58 You're going to want to communicate out to those partners that at those third party companies what your plans are for a specific quarter. 14:06 So that they are aware and they can support you as well. You're going to want to coordinate cross functional collaboration and alignment. 14:14 So if you're working on a feature and you actually need another team to help you or a marketing campaign to help you, you're going to want to coordinate all this work that goes into delivering successful products. 14:26 You're going to want to manage those expectations of the stakeholders, including executives, team members, and customers. So it's really important, as I mentioned, that you are clearly stating that the team is working on one thing right now. 14:39 We have explicitly decided not to work on this other thing or say you promised a feature to be delivered in a certain time frame. 14:47 If that's at risk of being delayed, you want to communicate that out to everyone's aware. So managing expectations of stakeholders is really, really important for the PM role. 14:57 Fourth is presenting product updates and progress to senior leadership. So you want to make sure that you are actually communicating the progress that your team is making every week or every two weeks to the senior leadership so that they're aware what your team is up to if there's any road blocks etc 15:14 so that they can from their level plan accordingly. And then fifth, you want to advocate for the product and the needs of its users within the organization. 15:24 So in this lesson, we really covered what are the essential role and responsibilities of a PM. Again, PMs are crucial for driving the product's success. 15:34 At the end of the day, the PM is the one that's really making sure that the product area, the feature all that goes into their area is driving and being successful within the organization. 15:46 It delivers value to the customers that's solving their problems and it aligns with the organization's goals at that time. So as you continue through this course, you're going to gain a much deeper understanding of each aspect of this process and how you can really apply these skills to create successful 16:03 products that really solve, again, solve user problems and are good for the business.","Learn how to define a product manager’s core responsibilities across strategy, execution, measurement, and stakeholder management so you can drive product outcomes that serve users and business goals.",387d1cf7-65a1-4e4c-8fb8-f21d4ea6547f,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Role & Responsibilities of a PM,1.1,FALSE,17,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:19.772559+00
650a587431d74e87b79f2cfcbaa4c013,"0:00 In this module, we're going to go over product pricing strategies. So the first lesson is just an intro to pricing strategy in general. 0:10 Pricing is a really important part of product management because it really directly impacts revenue that you are bringing in to your company, the profitability of your company. 0:20 And your overall market positioning. So in this lesson, I'm going to go over different fundamentals when it comes to pricing strategies and their importance really in developing a successful product. 0:31 So what is the role of pricing in product management? It plays a really big role because of several reasons. Number one, revenue. 0:40 So the right pricing strategy is essential for actually bringing in money, dollars, cash, into your business and ensuring the financial viability of your product. 0:52 Number two, competitive positioning. So your pricing can position you relative to all your different competitors, signaling whether your product is a premium offering or a cost-effective alternative. 1:05 So if you think of Toyota, Honda, these are cost-effective car brands that are appealing to the mass market whereas Mercedes, Porsche, these Audi, these types of brands, those are premium offerings. 1:21 They are trying to position themselves at the top of the market for a much smaller segment of the overall market. 1:28 Number three, perceived value. Price is often an indicator of perceived value and customers may associate higher prices with higher quality or more features. 1:37 So if you're charging a subscription and it's $10 per month. Versus charging $100 a month. When a customer sees $100 a month, they're going to associate something with that price. 1:49 Which is, wow, I must be getting a lot. In this subscription, if it's $1,200 a year versus $120 a year, that's a huge difference. 1:59 So I must be getting a lot. A lot more value. 10x the value from that product than, ah, the $10 a month one. 2:06 Customer acquisition and retention. So pricing can be a tool to attract new customers or retain existing ones through incentives, discounts, or loyalty programs. 2:17 So for example, if you have a subscription that's $30 a month, Adobe is is like, ah, well, kinda well known for this or maybe not just because I've upgraded and downgraded, but if you have a, an Adobe subscription that gets like Photoshop, Lightroom, etc., and it's $30 a month and then 2:33 you go to downgrade or cancel your subscription, they will likely offer you something like three months of half the price for, for your subscription, and they're able to retain, ah, a much higher percent of, ah, users who are potentially trying to cancel their subscriptions because of that. 2:51 So, what are some factors to consider when developing a strategy for your product? So number one, costs. So, understand your fixed and variable costs when it comes. 3:01 To delivering the service to, to make sure that you're actually going to generate a profit in the end. Number two, market demand. 3:09 So, analyze the demand and customer's willingness to pay to identify an optimal price point. OpenAI did this recently with ChatGBT. 3:19 They basically sent out a survey to everyone. And, a lot of people, they tried to figure out what would you actually be willing to pay for a monthly subscription of ChatGBT Premium. 3:30 And that's kind of how, one of the inputs into figuring out their price point of like, I think it's $20 a month. 3:37 Competitors. Research competitor pricing to understand your product's position in the open. Overall market. Determine if your pricing should be higher, lower, or like, about the same with competitors. 3:48 Target audience. So, consider your target audience demographics. Their preferences, their price sensitivity to tailor your pricing strategy to their needs. 3:57 Are your, is your audience generally like, middle class or, or low income? Are they, you know, are you making a product for the top 1% of earners? 4:07 Think about this when you're coming up with your pricing. Product lifecycle, cycle. So, be aware of your product's lifecycle stage because pricing strategies change over time. 4:17 Like, you might have introductory pricing for a new product that, that no one really knows about and then discounts for, for more mature products as an example. 4:26 Common pricing strategies. So, there's several different strategies and I'll, I'll go into this more but cost-based pricing. So, prices are determined by adding a markup to the actual cost of producing the product. 4:38 You could have value-based pricing and, and that's based on the perceived value that's, that the product is driving for the customer. 4:44 You could have competitor-based pricing. So, the prices are always set relative to competitor's pricing. Penetration pricing. So, you initially set low prices to get a lot of customers into the market, get a lot of reviews, get a lot of people talking about your product and then over time you increase 5:01 the price as the product becomes more established. And then skimming prices. You could set high initial prices for new products to capitalize on the first people who are going to test it out and then lower the price over time to go more mainstream or mass market with it. 5:16 So, in conclusion, a well-developed pricing strategy is really important for a successful product. Right. You want to consider things like the costs to deliver the product, the market demand for the product, competition, who is our actual target audience and customer, where are we on the product lifecycle 5:34 , and all these factors can go into developing your specific pricing approach for your product. Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to evaluate pricing factors and choose a pricing strategy so you can set prices that improve profitability and market positioning.,adc76dcd-6770-46eb-b20a-50a37bf6726e,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Introduction to pricing strategies,10.1,TRUE,6,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:22.158677+00
1558591d19ca443292b84c911dd39f9b,"0:00 In this lesson 10.2, I'm going to go over cost-based, value-based, and competitor-based pricing. Okay, so these are three different popular pricing strategies, and I really wanted to go into advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and then also provide an example to kind of illustrate how 0:17 they're applied in the real world. So the first one I'm going to show you is, to go into is cost-based pricing. So this is a straightforward approach that involves calculating the total cost of producing and delivering a product, and then adding a mark-up to determine the selling prices. 0:32 So here are some advantages. So it ensures profitability by 100% of the time covering the production costs and generating a profit margin. 0:40 It simplifies pricing decisions by focusing on the costs that are going into it and then the desired profit margins. And it also can be easily communicated to stakeholders as it's based on, you know, a tangible cost that people can take in. 0:56 Disadvantages it really ignores a customer's willingness to pay and the perceived value that you're getting out of it, which could result in basically missed revenue opportunities. 1:06 It also lacks flexibility in responding to market changes and competitor pricing and it may not account for non-cost factors like brand reputation or product differentiation. 1:17 These things can elevate the amount of money that someone is willing to pay. And it's not necessarily a fixed cost over time. 1:25 So the manufacturer produces a product at a cost of $50 per unit and then they decide to apply 40% markup. 1:32 So the selling price would be $70. That's $50 times 40%. And adding that on top. Okay, next is value-based pricing. 1:43 So this focuses on the actual perceived value of the product to the customer. So how much is the customer perceiving the product in terms of value to their overall lives rather than just like strictly looking at production costs? 1:56 So, this strategy aims to capture the most value that customers are willing to pay for a product regardless of the costs that are going into it. 2:05 So, some advantages. It aligns pricing with the customer's perception of value, and this is potentially maximizing the revenue that you can get generated for your product. 2:15 It encourages product differentiation and innovation to increase the perceived value that someone has. When it's getting out of it. How, you know, the perceived value being like, how much are they, is this product solving my core problem as a target customer. 2:31 It also provides flexibility to adjust pricing in response to market changes and competition. Some disadvantages. It can be challenging to accurately assess. 2:41 What is the customer's perceived value? How much are they willing to pay? It also requires continuous research and understanding of preferences and willingness to pay over time because it can obviously change over time. 2:53 And it may necessitate complex pricing structures to capture the varying value perceptions of different customer segments. So you might have 20% of your overall user base who may perceive your product as having immeasurable value, priceless, and they may be willing to pay $300 a month. 3:11 But that doesn't mean everyone is willing to pay $300 a month. And so you have to think about these different customer segments if you're going to go on the value-based pricing route. 3:21 An example here is that a software company may identify that customers are willing to pay $120 dollars per month for the product. 3:29 And that will provide significant time savings benefits. The company will then price the product at 99 a month capturing a large portion of this customer perceived value. 3:40 Okay next one is come ahead competitor based pricing. So this involves pricing that where you set the price relative to all the other competitors that are operating in your space. 3:51 So it's common in industries where the products are very similar to whether one another and people are very price sensitive meaning they're hyper aware of the amount of money that they're spending spending on it. 4:02 So some advantages here it simplifies pricing decisions by basically focusing on what others are doing. You can position the product strategically in the market so you can go like a little above and say your premium or a cost effective alternative you're going right below and it missed minimizes the 4:17 risk of price wars or loss of market share due to overpricing. Some disadvantages. It may result in a race to the bottom with companies continually lowering their prices to stay competitive. 4:29 For example, if there's an email kind of subscription service that's $10 a month and you come in at $9 a month that company may alter theirs to be $8.99 a month or $7 a month and, you know, when multiple competitors are doing this over and over again, you're driving to the bottom and overall 4:46 you're, you're, you're ending up getting less revenue over time, which is not great for a business. Also it does not account for unique product features, different unique value props brand reputation, and all those different things could justify higher pricing. 5:02 It also ignores cost structures and customers willingness to pay. So it, it may lead to lower profitability overall. So an example is that a new coffee shop that pops up on the corner might set its prices 5% lower than a popular competitor in the area, aiming to attract those price sensitive customers 5:19 who still value quality. This is something that makes commonly happen when a Starbucks pops in an area, pops up, you know, at $5, a coffee, $6, sometimes $9 a coffee. 5:30 You may have another coffee shop that is giving away coffee for $3 or $2.50. So in conclusion, in conclusion, choosing the right strategy depends on a variety of different factors. 5:44 Like what is your product offering? What industry are you operating in? Who is your target audience? What are the segmentations of your audience? 5:53 Cost-based pricing ensures profitability, but it may overlook customer value while value-based pricing maximizes revenue by capturing what people are actually perceiving the value of your product to be. 6:05 And then finally, competitor-based pricing that positions your product relative to the competition, but may lead to a race to the bottom if you're continually trying to under undercut the competitors. 6:17 So understanding these advantages and disadvantages of each strategy may help you to make a more informed. Decision for your specific product. 6:25 Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to compare cost-based, value-based, and competitor-based pricing strategies so you can choose the best pricing approach for your product and market.",065165e0-20a0-4491-86c9-f61b1857ae7f,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,"Cost, value, and competitor based pricing",10.2,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:22.630002+00
6114c021bc334d85ae7920a27db96a23,"0:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over pricing models and different monetization strategies. So we'll explore these models and the strategies that businesses can adopt to generate revenue. 0:11 I'll also discuss advantages and disadvantages as well as give examples as we go. So the first one is a one-time purchase. 0:18 This is when customers pay a single up front fee to obtain a product or service and it usually does not have any reoccurring payments of any sorts. 0:27 So some advantages. This simplifies pricing for the business and the customer. You know, businesses don't have to build in like a ton of tooling and functionality and software to manage those subscriptions, manage what happens when a subscription payment fails, etc. 0:42 It generates immediate revenue, improving cash flow. So it's not like you, you know, the lifetime value of someone is $100 and you get to that $100 by way of every month paying $10 and most customers stay at 12 months. 0:55 You just say this product is $100. You get that on day one and then your cash flow is really strong that way. 1:00 It also encourages customer commitment to the higher initial investment. So it's easy to cancel a subscription that's $10, but if you pay $100, you may try harder to actually find value from that product. 1:14 Some disadvantages, it limits opportunities for ongoing revenue and that's why a lot of businesses have adopted this subscription based services over time. 1:22 It may discourage customers who are hesitant to make this huge upfront investment, whereas customers may be more interested in just paying $10 a month, see how it goes, and they can always cancel it. 1:33 It also requires continuous acquisition of new customers to sustain revenue. So, for example, if you're a subscription based visit. Business and you have a high retention rate, you know, it's going to create a very sustainable business versus one time purchases. 1:48 You're always going to need to sell every single month and and hopefully increase how much you're selling each month. So an example of a one time purchase is a customer who buys a video game for 60 bucks. 2:00 Alright, next is to a subscription based pricing. So this is when customers pay a recurring fee. It's usually monthly or annually. 2:07 It can also be quarterly. It's kind of a contract basis, but it's a way to pay for ongoing access to a product or service over time. 2:16 So some advantages. It provides a predictable and steady revenue stream. As long as you have a high retention rate, it encourages a long term customer relationships and loyalty. 2:27 It can also, you can also offer multiple tiers to accommodate different customer preferences and budgets. Which makes it really a lot easier to capture different aspects of the segmentations of the overall market. 2:40 Some disadvantages. One, it may take longer to reach profitability because you have lower revenue per customer. Again, if each customer on month one brings in $10 versus $100, it may take a much longer time to actually get to profitability. 2:55 It also requires ongoing value delivery to justify those recurring payments, so your product can stay stagnant over time. Into their profits versus okay, let's do a one time $1,000 investment and then for the next five years we're going to be able to have this product. 3:29 So it's different mindset for different people. So an example of this is like Netflix or Hulu or everything like that. 3:36 All those video streaming services that are like 1299 a month or 799 a month. Thanks. Etc. Another option is a freemium model. 3:45 So this is where customers access a basic version of your product or service for free. And then the premium services are available for a paid amount of fee. 3:56 So some advantages here. There's a low barrier to entry for all the customers because all they Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. You know, have to do is sign up and then it's free and then they can act get access to kind of the core functionality, but not necessarily the premium functionality 4:10 . So it allows these customers to kind of trial it out and this is, you know, huge people test drive cars because they want to see how it drives how it feels. 4:19 So it allows customers to test the product. Before committing to a paid plan, you can also generate revenue from you can generate revenue from both free users and paid users. 4:30 So this is big with YouTube, for example, where YouTube now has these two models where it's like all most most customers are not paying and they watch ads and the ads generate revenue for the business. 4:43 YouTube as well as the creators, but now they also have the premium membership, which is a monthly subscription and those are considered the paid users and they don't have to watch ads. 4:53 So there's still ways to generate revenue from both free and paid users within the freemium model some disadvantages. So it requires a really careful and. 5:02 And calculated balance of free and paid features to encourage updates. You don't want to give away too much for free. 5:09 Where the premium option is not like good enough to justify that cost. But you don't want to give too little away where it's like no one can even find value from your product at the free tier. 5:21 Sometimes it can be challenging. It's challenging to convert free users to paying customers. So maybe, you know, you build this app or website and most people are getting enough value from the free version that they don't even want to consider upgrading. 5:35 It also may strain resources if a large number of free users are not converting to paid plans. If, you know, 90% of the customer support tickets are for free users, but only 10% of the user base is supplying the revenue for the entire business, it may strain resources. 5:58 An example of a freemium model is a project management software that offers a free plan features and then advanced features are available on paid plans that start at $10 per user per month. 6:10 This is very very common for project management software. Okay, the next one is pay as you go or usage based pricing. 6:18 So this is where customers are charged based on the usage of a product often build a set rate per month. 6:23 Per unit of consumption. So an example just to dive into that is that a cloud storage provider could charge 2 cents per gigabyte of data stored or an SMS provider that charges 0.075 dollars per SMS verification text. 6:38 These are really really common for those types of things where it wouldn't make sense. That's for you to have a subscription if every single customer is going to be using it in different ways. 6:49 So some advantages here. It aligns pricing with, again, what customers are actually using of it. So it increases the perceived value. 6:57 Also, it attracts customers who prefer to pay only for what they actually use. And it encourages higher usage and revenue generation from heavy users. 7:08 So if you have users who are sending 100 text messages per month you know, obviously it makes sense that someone who is sending 1 million text messages a month is going to be much different from the 100 text per month user. 7:25 Some disadvantages. It can lead to very unpredictable revenue streams because usage may vary. For example, during the COVID pandemic you may see that for a particular product usage might plummet because no one is coming into the, the in-person stores and you might have a product that 7:44 is spilt specifically for in-person stores. And so because it's tied exactly to the usage, you may decrease profitability there. It also may require very complex billing systems to track and bill for the right usage. 7:57 You have to keep track of how much people are using which is already a difficult problem and then you have to base your billing off of it. 8:03 And account for issues that come up and inconsistencies. It could also discourage usage if customers are concerned about unpredictable costs. 8:12 So if they're not necessarily confident about how much they'll use in a month, they may say this is too big of a risk for our business. 8:18 We, we can't have this. So in conclusion choosing the right pricing model and monetization strategy for your product oftentimes depends on different factors like the target market, the industry and the competition. 8:32 So one time purchase models, they provide immediate revenue but limit that ongoing revenue while subscription based pricing offers a steady revenue stream over time, over months and years. 8:43 These models encourage customers to try out the product, but you may struggle to actually get those free users to then pay. 8:52 Or pay as you go models aligns pricing with usage but may lead to unpredictable revenue which is never that great for a business. 9:00 So understanding these advantages and disadvantages of each model they're gonna help you make more informed decisions about which pricing strategy you deploy for your business and remember you can always test these things. 9:13 Nothing is ever set in stone so really think about testing them over time to find what works for your product. 9:18 Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to compare one-time, subscription, freemium, and usage-based pricing models so you can choose a monetization strategy that fits your product and market.",9b5c5877-c54f-420e-b10e-490651ec74ea,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Pricing models and monetization strategies,10.3,TRUE,10,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:23.199672+00
9a6a33042b334de984e6a74b444945b5,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over price segmentation and optimization. These are two essential concepts in crafting an effective strategy overall. 0:10 So by understanding the principles of each of these, you can create a more targeted approach to pricing and maximize your product's revenue potential. 0:18 So let's first hit price segmentation. So it involves kind of dividing the market, your overall user base into distinct groups based on their willingness to pay, their preferences, their characteristics, or other defining aspects about each one of them. 0:35 So what are the types of ways that we can segment the market when it comes to pricing? So demographic, we can segment based on factors like their age their gender, their income, or their education level. 0:48 The geographically, we can segment based on location. So the country that they're in, the region, the city, these are very common ways that you can price segment. 0:57 For example, Ubers in New York City are going to be more expensive than Ubers in maybe a city that isn't as expensive overall or the suburbs, for example. 1:08 Behavioral, so segment based on customer behavior, their purchase history, their usage patterns, or their loyalty status. Psychographics, so based on customer attitudes, beliefs, or lifestyle preferences in general. 1:21 Some advantages to segment price segmentation. It allows businesses to capture more value by targeting specific types of customer segments with tailored pricing. 1:32 So imagine if Uber just charged the same flat rate all across the United States. This really wouldn't work because you'd have to come up with a, price that works in every single market. 1:43 And for New York, the New York market, for example, it might be so cheap that Uber is inundated and there's basically never any Ubers available, which would really annoy a lot of customers versus if you have a price in a rural area that doesn't have a very high, income, you might, Ubers might be so 2:03 expensive to them and so by not segmenting pricing based on region, Uber is hurting themselves and their customers. Another advantage is it enables customers or companies, excuse me, to better serve their customer needs by understanding their preferences and willingness to pay. 2:20 It helps businesses, remain competitive by offering a range of options to meet all the diverse aspects of their customer base. 2:29 So an example of price segmentation could be a software company offering discounted pricing for students and non-profit organizations while maintaining standard pricing for other customers. 2:40 Apple does this as well. Okay, next, price optimization. So, price optimization is the process of determining the ideal price for a product or service to maximize overall revenue and profit or other business objectives. 2:56 For example, like if they just want to get a lot of users that are paying, but they want to get a lot of users. 3:01 Versus just maximizing revenue as fast as possible. So, some factors to consider when optimizing for price. The cost. You want to understand the costs associated with producing and delivering one additional product or service for the customers. 3:17 So, for example, if you have infrastructure costs, how much does that go up? Every time you onboard a new customer. 3:23 Number two, competition. So, analyze competitor pricing and offerings which will ultimately help you position your product effectively in the market. 3:33 Another one, customer willingness to pay. And we went over this in previous lessons, but to reiterate, estimate the maximum price that customers may be willing to pay for your product or service twist which is really important in making sure you're not over or under pricing. 3:48 And then price elasticity. So, understand the responsiveness of demand to price changes. And that could help for you to set prices that maximize revenue. 3:58 So as you decrease, decrease the price the demand will go up. As you increase price, the demand will go down. 4:05 But you wanna find that, like, sweet spot where you're maximizing revenue. So, what are some techniques for price optimization? Number one, market research. 4:14 So, you can collect data on customer preferences. You can collect data on what your competitors are doing and compare that. 4:20 You can look at market trends. To see if things are trending up, down, and in what direction. You could also run price experiments. 4:27 And this is pretty common. You can run A-B tests or other experiments that can help gather insights on customer price sensitivity and willingness to pay. 4:35 So you may consider working with your data science team to run a pricing experiment. Another one is data analytics. So, analyze historical sales data and customer behavior, which may be able to uncover, help you uncover patterns or inform pricing decisions for your product. 4:51 And then the next is price optimization software. So, you may want to invest in using specialized software that can actually help you model various pricing scenarios and determine the optimal price. 5:01 So. An example of a way to price optimize would be an e-commerce company that uses an A-B test to compare different price points for a product. 5:10 They analyze the results to determine which price ultimately maximizes the overall revenue. So, in conclusion, price segmentation and optimization are really important parts of developing a product. 5:22 So, in conclusion, price segmentation and optimization a good, strong pricing strategy for your product. By doing this you can capture more value and better serve needs. 5:30 Also, like, by optimizing your prices, you are going to want to consider costs, competition, customer willingness to pay, and that's going to help you overall maximize and optimize your product's revenue. 5:42 So hopefully this helped understand that segmentation and optimization are really important parts of creating a strong pricing strategy for your specific product. 5:53 Alright, see you in the next one.","Learn how to segment customers by willingness to pay and optimize prices using costs, competition, and elasticity so you can maximize revenue while serving diverse customer needs.",be814aeb-3951-45e8-9101-0b046077042f,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Price segmentation and optimization,10.4,TRUE,6,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:23.665164+00
3be79680818447578f2cc8ef48c16de6,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over pricing experiments and analysis. I kind of touched on this in previous lessons, but I want to chat quickly through the importance of pricing experiments in your overall strategy and by, by learning about this, you're figure out like that one this is an 0:18 effective tool and to the touch of things that you can learn coming out of a pricing experiment. So why conduct pricing experiments to begin with? 0:27 They can help businesses test different strategies and gather data on customer behavior and preferences. They'll allow you to understand customer's price sensitivity and their willingness to pay. 0:39 They'll help identify optimal price points that maximize revenue or profit. With all these things, it's basically impossible, it's very difficult to guess at them, so you want to get hard cold data to inform these decisions. 0:55 It'll also test, it's a way to test effectiveness of discounts, promotions, or different prices. So you may want to test what happens when we have a free plan versus we remove a free plan and just have paid plans. 1:08 It also validates different assumptions about marketing, market segments, and their pricing preferences that you may be having with your team. 1:16 So what are the type of pricing experiments that can be run? AB tests, we've gone over this a bunch, comparing two or more pricing options to see which performs better. 1:25 So an example is that a e-commerce website might test different prices for a specific product. You could do a conjoint analysis, which is a research method used to understand customer preferences by presenting them with a combination of product features and prices and then analyzing their choices. 1:41 You know, you would run different groupings basically of products, price that at a certain point and then see how that compares to other groupings. 1:50 Next, price elasticity testing. So you want to analyze how changes in price will impact the demand for a product or service. 1:57 And that helps you to determine the optimal price to maximize revenue. Additionally, time-limited offers. So you might test the effectiveness of discounts or special offers for a limited time to gauge customer response. 2:10 So maybe you have no fees for Uber Eats for the first 30 days. How does it actually impact the revenue that is generated on a user-by-user basis? 2:21 Don't forget to click on the bell so you don't miss out on any of our latest videos. We'll see you next time. These are the types of things that you'll want to consider testing so you get more data around them before you just put them in the product experience. So how do you actually conduct a pricing 2:34 experiment? Number one, you want to define the objective. What is the goal for your experiment? Like what are you trying to understand as a customer preferences or identifying the optimum price or something else? Then you'll want to select the right method. 2:43 So is it an A-B test? Is it a conjoint? Analysis, etc. You'll want to design the experiment. So develop the experimental design, the variables, the hypothesis, the sample size, the duration, the metrics, etc. 2:56 Then you'll want to implement it with your team, launch the experiment, ensure it's set up properly, and you're actually getting data from the experiment. 3:04 Then finally you want to analyze the results. So examine the data to draw insights. How did it actually perform with users? 3:11 How much revenue did we drive, etc. So analyzing. So there's different ways to actually do this. You can do a statistical analysis. 3:19 So you can use statistical methods with your data. A team to analyze the data and determine if any differences in customer behavior or preferences are significant coming out of the test that you ran. 3:30 You also may be able to identify patterns and trends. So look for patterns and trends in the data that you've collected that can inform the pricing strategy moving forward. 3:39 So you may look at a specific customer segment. And see that they have different price sensitivities. Evaluate the impact of your pricing experiment on key metrics, different KPIs. 3:49 So assess the impact on you know, different tiers of pricing like how much revenue is driven, how much profit, what is the customer acquisition rates that we saw or the retention rates, what user engagement are we seeing within the premium plan versus the pre-plan except free plan 4:07 , et cetera. And then finally, refine your strategy. So take the insights that you've gathered and you may want to decide, okay, it's, it's good. 4:15 We are content or happy with the pricing strategy we have, or you may want to change it and make a bit of a, a tweak based on the insights we've gathered. 4:24 So here's an example of a pricing experiment. So an online retailer might conduct an AB test to compare the impact of a 10% discount versus a 20% discount on a specific product. 4:36 So the retail retailer analyzes the results and they find that the 20% discount generates more. So as you can see on the price imagine on the right, imagine the product price is a hundred bucks. 4:51 So we have these two buckets here. We're going to give a discount of 10% to a segment of users and then we're going to give a discount of 20% to the user. 5:02 And we see that the $90 version, the 10% discount, that drove 324 sales, so the total revenue was $29,160 versus 20%. 5:16 This drove 21 more sales. So right off the bat, you may think, okay, this is, this is better. It's selling more products. 5:22 But, when you actually calculate the revenue, it's 2,000, almost $2,000 less, than the 10% discount. So based on this pricing experiment that was run, the retail, retailer might opt for the 10% to maximize revenue overall. 5:40 So the next time they do a promotion, they're, they're gonna use this 10% instead of 20%, even though they, they may have thought that, okay, the 20% is gonna drive more sales, but the revenue is going to be less. 5:51 So in conclusion, pricing experiments and analysis are really important tools that you can deploy for your product. By conducting these experiments, analyzing your results, you can get valuable insight into what are, what's our customer, our target customer behavior which may be different than 6:09 what we see on other competitors, etc. What are their preferences and overall, what is the performance of the pricing strategy that we deployed. 6:16 So this knowledge is going to really help you to make more informed and effective pricing related decisions for your product. 6:23 Whether it's a new product or it's been around for a long time. This is ultimately going to help your company achieve high revenue and profit outcomes.","Learn how to design, run, and analyze pricing experiments to choose optimal prices and promotions that maximize revenue or profit.",7b5f5b2b-cc4f-4bc6-9a8c-9eeaceb0f0b4,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Pricing experiments and analysis,10.5,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:24.185561+00
848cda8ccd144ff381685ac1c6eda1ff,"0:00 Welcome to module 11. This is the product lifecycle management module. So in the first lesson here, we're going to go over the stages of the product lifecycle. 0:09 And that is really the progression of a product through various stages from its introduction into the market when it first launches until it's eventual decline in production. 0:20 And then we're going to go over the stages of the product lifecycle management. And then we're going to go over the stages of the product lifecycle management. 0:40 Okay, so, I'm going to quickly go through the different stages of the product lifecycle. So, number one is introduction. This is when a product is first launched in the market. 0:51 One of the first things you're going to be doing is creating awareness of a product. Attracting early adopters and just establishing yourself and your product in the market. 1:00 So, sales and profits are generally low at this stage and there may be limited competition depending on if you're going zero to one or if you're trying to compete in a market where there already is competitors. 1:13 The next phase is the growth phase. So, this stage is where the product gains traction. It experiences growth. In sales and market share. 1:23 So the customer base expands. The company may invest more in marketing efforts production capacity and distribution channels. We're trying to get more and more customers to come into our product and find value from it. 1:36 And this is where competition usually starts to increase because other companies are finding out that we are solving problems in this area. 1:44 So they're gonna start to compete in that area as well. The next stage is maturity. So as the market becomes saturated, the growth of the product slows down. 1:54 It reaches its peak in terms of sales and profits. During the maturity stage, the focus shifts from maintaining market share, optimizing operational efficiency and exploring new markets or customer segments because you really want to evolve the business overall. 2:11 So we want to maintain how much of the market we've actually obtained and then look at other ways, new markets that we can get into, other ways we can expand our revenue. 2:21 So competition at this stage of a product life cycle is typically very high and companies need to differentiate themselves through innovating or increasing their and improving their customer experience or whatever you know, way the, the companies need to innovate at this stage to stay competitive 2:39 and avoid. Decline, which is the last stage. So decline is when the product experiences a decline in sales and market share due to changing customer preferences, tech advancements that your company has not made or increased competition. 2:55 Your competitors are doing something that you're not and you're losing out in users and new users. So companies may decide to phase out a product. 3:07 They may reduce marketing efforts for a product, or they more might explore opportunities to extend their product or kind of reinvent it. 3:16 So the importance of understanding the product lifecycle. So, number one is, is developing stage specific strategies. So by understanding the lifecycle, PMs can create effective strategies tailored to each stage, like customer acquisition during the intro phase or cost optimization during the maturity 3:35 phase. The next is anticipating market changes. So understanding this lifecycle is going to help you anticipate what might happen in the market. 3:43 You may be able to make more proactive decisions based on this to stay competitive. Next is optimizing resource allocation. So PMs may allocate resources more efficiently by focusing on the most critical activities for each stage of the lifecycle. 3:58 And then finally managing a product portfolio. Understanding the lifecycle stages for multiple products within a company's entire portfolio will help PMs make more informed decisions about what they should prioritize, what they should invest in, and maybe if they should retire a specific product. 4:16 So in conclusion, the lifecycle of products are really an important concept to understand for PMs because it allows them to develop strategies for each stage more effectively. 4:28 They can optimize resources on their team, they can anticipate what might happen next, and be more proactive about it to ultimately ensure the product is successful throughout its lifetime in the market.",Learn how to identify product lifecycle stages and apply stage-specific strategies so you can allocate resources wisely and plan for market changes.,50b7c184-2717-4bec-a083-f58ac79bfba7,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Stages of the product lifecycle,11.1,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:24.64562+00
fc8a6465c7e24f04930598d81ba61fb7,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over growth and scaling strategies. So, I'm going to discuss the different ways that you can increase market share for your product, expand your customer base, and expand revenue during the growth stage of the product lifecycle. 0:17 So, these strategies really aim to help you capture the growth stage of the product lifecycle. So, let's start with customer acquisition. 0:30 You could expand marketing efforts. You could invest in marketing campaigns to reach a broader audience and create awareness about the product. 0:38 So, this might include online activities or offline activities, content marketing, and public relation efforts. All, all in an effort to just get more bodies, more people, more eyeballs on your product out in the world. 0:51 The next is a referral program. So, maybe you've had some initial success with a customer base. You might encourage existing customers to then refer new customers on to the platform by way of offering discounts or rewards. 1:05 This can be extremely powerful if every single user is on average referring more than one user to the platform. Your product is going to really be able to grow quickly. 1:17 Partnerships and collaboration. You may want to partner with other companies in influencers or industry leaders to leverage their audience, their user base create credibility with your product and then reach, ultimately reach new customer segments. 1:31 Okay, on the product development side, you may want to launch new features and enhancements. So as you go on, you'll want to continuously improve the product by adding new features, adding new functionality, solving new problems, or solving problems in a better way. 1:48 You should base this on customer feedback and market research that you're doing. The next is product line extensions. So you could expand the overall portfolio of products that your company offers by offering new products, new variations to those products. 2:01 And this is going to be able to reach a broader segment of the overall market. You're going to solve different pain points that different customers have. 2:11 Localization and customization. So you may adapt the product to cater to different markets or customer segments by offering localized or customized versions. 2:21 So when it comes to international websites, you may want to, say you're a website building platform, you may want to internationalize the product by allowing customers to put in a language filter into their product or a translation feature. 2:35 These are ways that you'll be able to expand much further into different areas of the world. The next is around distribution channels and sales strategies. 2:45 So the first one, channel expansion. You may increase product availability and reach by expanding distribution channels and a couple examples of those are retailers, resellers, or distributors. 2:57 So think about like Apple for example. Apple historically, you know, they they were selling, I mean at the beginning out of a garage, but then they expanded to retail stores. 3:07 Now they're in other locations that you can buy Mac and Apple products like Amazon or Best Buy. In Best Buy, there are literal Apple Apple hubs in those stores. 3:19 International markets. So explore opportunities. To expand internationally. Conduct market research to make sure that it's, you know, wanted in a region. 3:29 Understand the regulations in that region. GDPR is a really important one. And then tailor marketing and sales strategies to the local preferences. 3:39 And then finally pricing strategies. So you could you know, as, as explored in previous modules, implement different pricing strategies that appeal to different segments of the market. 3:50 So, such as like offering discounts of volume-based pricing or tiered pricing models as well. The next is around operational efficiency and scalability. 3:59 Excuse me. So process optimization. You might streamline or optimize business processes and, and by doing that, whether it's internally with your, your teams, whether it's the onboarding process for new customers, ultimately you're going to reduce costs and improve efficiency as the company 4:18 grows, which leads to more revenue. You might automate things. And leverage technology in ways in, in things that are being done manually right now. 4:26 So this will allow you to scale your operations and support functions without compromising quality or customer service. Finally, talent and organizational structure. 4:37 Over time, you want to hire and retain the right talent, establish a scalable organization KTVU Fox two news. Structure that supports the company's growth objectives. 4:45 So all in all I think growth and scaling strategies that meant that were kind of mentioned during this lesson are really important. 4:54 When the company that you're operating in and the product you're managing is in the growth stage of the overall life cycle. 5:02 So you can leverage these strategies to capitalize on the product success, expand their reach, and maintain a competitive advantage overall. 5:10 So again, to quickly review that's, you know, expanding customer acquisition methods advancing the product looking into different distribution channels, maybe optimizing operations and making them more effective. 5:22 Through all these different things you can maintain and, and ensure sustainable growth and success for your product in the growth aspect and stage of the product lifecycle.","Learn how to apply growth-stage strategies across acquisition, product development, distribution, pricing, and operations so you can expand market share and revenue sustainably.",c35de382-10a8-4f42-bb5a-be03d218f930,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Growth and scaling strategies,11.2,TRUE,6,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:25.103209+00
eff303713bb54803a942d8ac29d43dbb,"0:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over feature sun setting and product retirement. So we'll discuss the importance of sun setting features or retiring products in general that are no longer relevant or profitable or really make sense within the portfolio of your overall product offering and company. 0:18 PMs play a very important part. In these decisions and it can be challenging but necessary to optimize resources and maintain a streamlined effective overall product portfolio. 0:30 So how do we identify candidates of features and functionality to sunset or retire? Number one is low usage or adoption. 0:38 You want to look at your overall usage metrics to identify what features or products have low adoption rates or declining usage patterns. 0:46 You know, if something is only being used 3% of the time or it started out as 20% of users and now it's 5% of users because of other features and functionality or it's not really a pain point anymore, it may make sense to retire this feature. 1:00 Sunset it and the reason is because of high maintenance costs. The, the cost of maintaining features or products is typically high. 1:09 Developers on your team need to monitor it. They need to fix it. They need to support it at answer questions about it. 1:15 Also the infrastructure costs associated with managing that feature. You know, if, if you're storing data for it if you're, you know, you need uptime for it, these are things that will cost money. 1:28 And, and high maintenance costs for something that isn't really being used a lot, maybe justification for sunsetting it. And then finally, competitive landscape. 1:36 Analyze the competitive landscape to identify features or products that really are no longer competitive or have become obsolete due to different aspects of the market changes in the market or technological advances that have happened. 1:50 The next is around communicating the decision. So, once you've decided that it is the right time to sunset a feature, you're going to want to back it up. 2:00 It may become as a surprise to people. So, there's two aspects to it, internal and external. On the internal front, you're going to want to inform the relevant internal stakeholders like the developers, the support staff, the sales team about the decision to sunset a feature or retire a product. 2:19 You want, when you're doing this communication, you're going to want to provide very clear reasons for why it actually makes sense for us to sunset this feature. 2:28 You'll want to include timelines so that they understand overall when is this happening and then ultimately these different ways are going to support you know, allow you to be supported in this decision to sunset the feature. 2:43 The next is on customer communication. So you want to notify customers in advance about the upcoming changes to the product and provide a clear timeline for it for this. 2:53 It would be horrible if just one day a feature disappeared from the users because some may really rely on it even though it's a small amount. 3:01 Some may still rely on it. And so you may want to send an email to the customer saying, you know, by December 31st, this feature will no longer be supported. 3:11 Before then, we've given you a way to migrate, etc. So offer alternatives if they're available and explain the benefits of transitioning to newer features or products within your portfolio. 3:20 So then how do we transition customers? You know, they were used to this thing being there and then it's not going to be there. 3:27 What do we do in between? So there's two aspects. Migration plans is the first. So you want to develop a migration plan to help customers transition from whatever feature you're deprecating or retiring to a newer offer. 3:41 Bring if it's available. So provide the right documentation, provide the support, communicate to them proactively and frequently and allow your support teams to be trained to ensure a smooth transition from the product or feature that you're retiring to a new one if it's applicable. 4:02 X is around customer retention. So you want to make sure that while you're actually retiring or sunsetting a particular feature or product that you do retain those customers. 4:13 You want to deploy strategies to minimize churn and maintain loyalty during this process. So you may offer incentives or discounts. 4:22 Or personalized assistance to encourage customers to adopt new features or products. So if someone is, you know, if you've identified that out of your entire user base, 5% are, you know, avid users of this feature that you're sunsetting. 4:36 You may offer that 5% massive discounts on the next year of their subscription. Sha- So that you can retain them. 4:44 You know, it would be really bad if all of a sudden you lost 5% of your user base because that's a pretty significant chunk of revenue. 4:51 So then it comes to decommissioning the feature or product. So there's the technical aspects of this. You're gonna coordinate with the engineers on your team and the operations team to decommission the product. 5:02 From the code base, infrastructure, and other systems like internal tools you know, metrics, dashboards, etc. The next is on support and documentation. 5:12 So you'll update product documentation both internal and external, update support materials, and training resources to remove references to the sunsetted feature or product. 5:22 So imagine if you have 100 help articles out there in your support center and 13 of them references feature, you're going to want to make sure that those references are removed. 5:34 And then finally, you might want to do a post-mortem analysis. So you might want to identify lessons learned from the sunsetting or retirement process. 5:42 And then apply these insights moving forward to improve different decisions that you might want to make on your team. So in conclusion, feature, sunsetting, or product retirement, it's, it's a really healthy aspect of product, product lifecycle management. 5:59 Google is actually very well known for spitting up products. PMs must be careful to evaluate different candidates for sunsetting your retirement, communicate that decision effectively, both internally, externally really support customers during the transition and avoid churn when possible, 6:19 and then actually decommission the feature in a structured and coordinated manner. By effectively managing this process, PMs can optimize resources on their team and maintain a coherent streamlined product portfolio that is modern and allows the team to deliver value to customers in a more effective 6:37 way. Alright, I'll see you in the next one.","Learn how to evaluate, communicate, and execute feature sunsetting or product retirement so you can reduce maintenance costs, prevent churn, and streamline your product portfolio.",34ff3f02-f887-42d3-9893-992a6d2a429e,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Feature sunsetting and product retirement,11.3,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:25.533407+00
e3eadda1f822408a8916751dff1f6cea,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over continuous improvement and innovation. So I'm going to discuss the importance of both of these when it comes to product management. 0:10 PMs play a vital role in fostering a culture of innovation on their team and make Make sure that the product evolves over time to meet changes. 0:25 So the first one here, fostering a culture of innovation. The first thing that's important is to encourage experimentation. You want to make sure that you're creating an environment where your team feels comfortable proposing and testing new ideas. 0:40 That they can, they can test with in the market in your product, even if they may fail. Encourage calculated risks and learn from those failures and, and really get excited about these successes. 0:53 Number two is around cross-functional collaboration. You want to promote collaboration between your team and other teams, whether it's your product team and other product teams, your product team and the marketing teams or customer support teams, et cetera. 1:07 Because diverse perspectives really drive towards innovative solutions. So promote collaboration between different types of teams. And then lastly, continuous learning. 1:17 You want to encourage members of your team to stay updated with different trends in your industries, different technologies that are advancing, whether it's camera technology or artificial intelligence or machine learning or, or different technologies. 1:32 Ultimately all of this drives to innovation for your product, which is really what we're hoping for. The next is making sure that you're innovation is customer centric, not just innovative to be innovative. 1:45 It has to really center around the user. So number one is around user feedback. You want to regularly collect and analyze feedback from your users to identify areas of improvement and potential new features that you could be building. 1:59 The next is customer research. So, conduct research like interviews and surveys to gain insights into what your customers need what are their pain points and how do they change over time, and ultimately this can drive towards product innovation. 2:15 And then finally, use data alongside all of this. You want to be making data-driven decisions when you're identifying. What to work on because to, to go back to what I've said in previous lessons, the worst thing that you can do as a product manager is guess. 2:29 The next is around iterative product development. So we went over Agile in, in a previous module, but you would want to adopt Agile methodologies to iteratively develop and improve your product over time. 2:42 Leverage MVPs. Start with an MVP and refine it based on what you're learning from users. This can again be from a zero to one product or it can be for just a new feature within your existing ecosystem or a new redesign of your product, etc. 2:57 And then finally rapid prototyping. So use rapid prototyping. As a technique to quickly test and validate ideas before you invest further resources into developing it. 3:09 While you're doing all of this, you want to make sure you're measuring and monitoring innovation in certain ways. So KPIs are one of the biggest one. 3:17 What are the key performance indicators of your product area? How do we know we're being successful? Next, regular reviews. You want to conduct regular reviews to assess the progress of innovation initiatives and make data-driven decisions to adjust priorities or resources on your team. 3:35 And then finally, have an innovation pipeline. You want to maintain this pipeline of innovative ideas, prototypes, experiments. That you can run to ensure a steady flow of improvements and new features to the product. 3:46 One thing that I think is really cool is when companies do hackathons. This allows people to be really creative, especially the engineers to, to take a step back outside of their normal day to day and just truly innovate for the customer experience. 4:00 So in conclusion, continuous improvement. And innovation are really important to maintain a competitive edge against all the competitors that quickly pop up in today's changing and rapidly growing markets. 4:13 PMs are going to be at the forefront of this. They, they want to, you know, you want to make sure you're fostering this culture of innovation and experimentation. 4:22 You want to make sure that what you're actually working on is customer centric and not just based off of gut feeling or things that you may be interested in building yourself. 4:32 You want to embrace like building MVPs and then iterating on them. And then all while doing this, measuring your progress, measuring your success and measuring your failures. 4:43 So by doing this, you can ensure that the products you are managing evolve over time. They meet customer needs and then stay ahead of the competition. 4:51 Alright, thanks for watching.","Learn how to foster customer-centric continuous innovation using experimentation, feedback, MVP iteration, and KPIs so you can evolve your product to stay competitive.",a382f222-7c7b-49f2-8b54-ebedc12ca9ad,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Continuous improvement and innovation,11.4,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:26.143172+00
83a587c184fd425a8afc55048e6753e5,"0:00 Welcome to Module 12. This is around stakeholder management and communication. So the first lesson here is on identifying and managing these stakeholders that you have. 0:11 So we'll discuss the importance of stakeholder management and different communication methods that you can deploy as a product manager. It's really important as a PM to identify the importance of stakeholder management. Identify who are your stakeholders, engage with them, manage them to ensure that 0:25 you're successfully developing your products, launching your products and supporting them on an ongoing basis. So identifying stakeholders is the first piece here. 0:33 There's two real groups of stakeholders. There's internal and external. So in terms of internal stakeholders, these are people within your company. 0:42 They're team members from various different departments like engineering, design, marketing, sales, customer support, legal, etcetera. You know, there's typically one, maybe two different main stakeholders that you should have within each of these organizations. 0:58 And they'll be your, your go-to person for questions. So these people are directly involved with the development, promotion, and overall support of the product. 1:09 Okay. Now that we've done internal, there's also external stakeholders. So these are people outside of the company. They include customers. 1:17 They include partners, investors, regulators, tours. Or suppliers, for example. They have a direct or indirect interest in the product success but they're not necessarily a part of the organization. 1:30 So one thing that you can do is create a visual representation of the stakeholders that you have to deal with within your product. 1:37 What are their interests and what is their influence on the product? And this is going to help you prioritize and manage those relationships and their involvement more effectively. 1:47 So understanding stakeholder needs and expectations. There's a couple things here. Number one is stakeholder analysis. So right when you start your role and over the next several weeks, you might want to conduct interviews with them, surveys, and, and use it. 2:01 Other research methods to gather information about their needs, their expectations for your team, for your product, what their concerns are because your team likely may not be new. 2:11 Next is prioritization. So determine the priority of stakeholder needs and expectations based on their importance and influence on the project. 2:19 So, you know, you may have a bunch of requests from different stakeholders and you likely won't be able to satisfy all of their needs and so you want to prioritize them. 2:30 Next is balancing stakeholders interests. So develop different ways to balance competing stakeholder interests and find mutually beneficial solutions. For example you know, a legal person may have different needs and expectations of your product compared to a marketing person and you want to find 2:48 middle ground that ultimately is going to pave the way for success for your product. When it comes to engaging and communicating with your stakeholders there's really two ways. 2:58 There's one-on-one communications and this is where you want to identify a way that works best for you and the stakeholder to continue conversations throughout your time at the company, whether it's one-on-one video calls, one-on-one DMs, etc. 3:12 And then the second aspect is sending regular updates. You want to provide stakeholders with frequent updates on progress of your team, challenges, and different achievements of the product area to maintain transparency and really build trust with them. 3:27 In terms of managing stakeholder expectations, there's a couple things here. Number one is setting clear objectives. So really make sure that they understand what is the goal of your product area, what is the scope, what are the deliverables, and that's going to allow you to manage stakeholder expectations 3:44 . Next is being transparent about how you're making decisions. So involve the stakeholders in the decision making process and communicate the rationale behind decisions as you make them. 3:55 And then finally, change management. Effectively manage changes to the product scope or timeline as they come up. Communicate the image. 4:02 Connect the impact to these changes to stakeholders. Inevitably something is going to go wrong. Something is going to cause a delay here or there and you want to just expect this to happen and effectively manage when it does end up happening. 4:16 So in conclusion, effective stakeholder management and communication, they're really important skills for P.I. M.S. By identifying and understanding needs and expectations of the different stakeholders, whether it's within marketing or sales or legal, like engaging with them effectively and learning 4:32 from them, hearing from them and managing their expectations. You'll be able to build strong relationships and ensure success for your product area. 4:41 All right, I'll see you in the next one.","Learn how to identify internal and external stakeholders, analyze and prioritize their needs, and communicate clear expectations so you can build trust and deliver successful products.",27d07294-f4ef-4809-9f01-80273d22e306,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Identifying and managing stakeholders,12.1,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:26.598738+00

So effective communication in general is really important for product managers. 0:11 It allows you to articulate your vision, establish trust with stakeholders, internal and external, and align people with common goals. So in this lesson, I'm going to go over a couple effective techniques that you can deploy to communicate well with stakeholders, teams, and other key groups like your 0:29 user base. So number one is around active listening. Active listening is a communication technique that involves listening to the speaker with full attention. 0:38 100% attention taking in what they're saying and responding appropriately. So you want to, you know, number one, pay attention as the speaker is speaking to you. 0:49 Demonstrate that you're listening by nodding, making eye contact, regurgitating what they're saying, literally saying out loud. So if I'm understanding what you're saying correctly, it's that x, y, y. 1:01 You want to ask open-ended questions to allow them to clarify their message. And you really want to avoid interrupting the speaker. 1:09 Do not jump in and interrupt them when they're mid-thought. So an example is that during a stakeholder meeting, a PM may listen actively to feedback from the stakeholder and then summarize the main points to show them what they're saying. So that they understand, they may be taking notes during 1:22 this meeting then summarize at the end. Next is clear and concise messaging. So this is a really important aspect of product management because it helps to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations. 1:35 So to ensure clear and concise messaging, you should use simple, concise language Thank you. That, you know, anyone who is, who's joining into the conversation or reading a document will understand. 1:46 Avoid jargon and technical terms, really dumb things down. And then use clear and precise visuals to explain complex concepts. So if there's something that you're trying to communicate that ultimately is a really complicated, you know, idea or concept. 2:01 I'll see you next time. Try to come up with a visual to explain it. So an example here is that a PM may create a visual diagram to explain a complex process to their team rather than using a lengthy email. 2:13 So this could be like a flow chart as an example to describe and communications flow rather than just a real really long block of text. 2:24 The next is tailor communication style. So PMs must tailor their communication style depending on the stakeholder or team that they're talking to. 2:33 So it involves understanding that direct person's communication style, their preferences, and then adapting accordingly. So identify the stakeholder or team's, ah, team members' communication style to begin with. 2:44 Is it seeing things in one-pagers? Is it just being directly messaged? Is it posting in a channel? Is it meeting with them face-to-face for 15 minutes? 2:54 Adapt the communication style you deploy to suit their unique preferences. And then when you're doing it, make sure you're clear and concise. 3:03 So an example here is a PM who identifies that a stakeholder really prefers data-driven analyses and prepared charts and graphs to communicate product performance. 3:13 Okay, the next is passion and influence, or persuasion and influence, sorry. These involve convincing stakeholders to support a particular product or feature that you're trying to push forward. What could they possibly ask about what I'm about to tell them? Come up with answers ahead of time to 3:47 their potential questions. So step into their shoes and brainstorm and then tailor the message and delivery to suit their communication style. 3:55 So an example here is that a PM uses market research to create a really compelling argument for the development of a new feature and then they use tailored messaging to persuade the stakeholders that it's the right thing to do. 4:07 So in conclusion, effective communication is really important in product management. By actively listening, communicating clearly and concisely to the stakeholder, by tailoring the communication style on based on each each stakeholder's unique needs, and then using persuasion and influence, PMs 4:26 can build strong relationships with them. They can align people with common goals and ultimately drive success for their product. Alright, I'll see you in the next.","Learn how to use active listening, concise messaging, tailored communication, and persuasion with stakeholders so you can build trust and align teams around product goals.",4398f009-f37b-45e2-99a4-f2851461a411,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Effective communication techniques,12.2,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:27.085356+00
267bb7969abf494d8f7a235f8459e3c8,"0:00 In this lesson 12.3, I'm going to go over leading cross functional teams. So, a quick intro here. So, cross functional teams are comprised of individuals with a diverse skill set or area of expertise. 0:15 They're all working together to achieve a common goal or objectives. So, these types of teams are included. Increasingly common in today's business world. 0:23 They allow organizations to bring people with different perspectives, knowledge skill sets to solve these complex problems and make strategic decisions and drive forward success for their products. 0:34 So, in order to effectively lead these teams, PMs must possess a specific set of skills and techniques and and this lesson I'm going to go over those skills and techniques in detail. 0:45 So, the first thing that you'll want to do is define clear roles and responsibilities. It's really important that each member of the team knows what they're responsible for, knows their role, what are they supposed to be doing, how are they supposed to be contributing. 0:58 It's really important especially for people who are coming from different departments and have different areas of expertise rather than engineers and designers who know pretty much exactly what their role within the team is. 1:10 And then it's important to have a clear understanding of each, everyone's strengths and weaknesses so that they can be assigned tasks to really make sure that they are supported well. 1:21 It aligns with their skill set. Okay. Next is setting clear goals and expectations. So before you start any project, it's important that you are clearly outlining the goal and expectation of the team. 1:33 It'll help ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same objective. They have the same goal post in mind. 1:39 The goals should be submitted. They should be measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This is typically referred to as a SMART goal. 1:47 This will help the team stay focused to the end result and really work towards achieving it efficiently. Next is fostering open communication. 1:56 It's really important that the people on your team are effectively communicating. Everyone should be open and transparent about what's going on. 2:09 It'll make sure people are on the same page. They're working towards the same goal. And then the communication while doing this should be regular, clear, and concise. 2:16 And it's also important to actually listen to everyone's opinions and ideas and provide Bye. Feedback in a constructive manner. If you don't agree with something, you know, you should be open and honest about it, but do it in a constructive manner rather than just dismissing it as not the right thing 2:33 to do. Next, one thing that is great to do is to build trust. So trust is really important for a team to succeed. 2:42 Team members must rely on each other's expertise and work collaboratively towards a common goal. And if you aren't making sure that people trust each other, you know, it's going to break down one way or another. 2:53 So as a PM, it's important that you foster this environment of trust by recognizing and valuing the contributions of each team member, encouraging a sense of ownership and accountability. 3:04 So if the marketing person is, is you know, taking on the lead of, from, you know, the perspective of getting users to use your product, you want to make sure that other people on your team are actually trusting them to do that. 3:18 And, and one way to do this is to recognize and value the contributions that marketing person is making to the team. 3:26 The next is encouraging innovation. So cross-functional teams especially, they can really bring fresh perspectives and ideas to the table because it includes people who aren't like in the trenches on a day-to-day basis trying to brainstorm this stuff. 3:40 So it's important to encourage members to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to the problems that you're actually dealing with. 3:48 Creating an environment that supports experimentation and that takes calculated risks can lead to breakthroughs that drive business successes. You know, when they say that, you know, more than, you know, you can't come up with the best solution in yourself and, and more brains are better than one 4:04 . That is literally true. A lot of the time people just can't think of all the different ways to solve a problem. 4:10 And so having different people in the room really, really helps. The next is leading with empathy. You know, leading cross-functional teams requires a high level of emotional intelligence and empathy. 4:21 It's important to understand everyone's strengths, weaknesses, and motivations and provide support and guidance as needed. If you notice that someone on the cross-functional team doesn't really seem engaged, you might want to reach out individually to understand what's going on. 4:35 Do they, do they not feel like they can contribute? Did someone say something, et cetera. So it includes It's r- recognizing and addressing any conflicts that may arise and, and, and do this in a timely and professional manner. 4:48 So now I just wanted to go over two quick examples of doing this effectively. So a PM at a tech startup is leading a cross-functional team to develop a new app. 4:59 So that on the team there's developers, there's designers, and then there's marketing things. So the PM might assign different tasks based on each team members strengths and set clear goals for the team and expectations for the project. 5:12 The PM may foster open communication and encourages team members to really think creatively and share their ideas about how we should best create this new app. 5:21 She also leads with empathy by recognizing what contributions each team member is making and provide support and guidance as needed throughout the product development process. 5:32 Another example is a PM at a retail company who's leading a cross-functional team to develop a new loyalty program. So this team may consist of marketers, data analysts, and customers. 5:42 So the PM here is going to define clear roles and responsibilities for each team member that joins. They'll set goals and expectations and then really encourage open communication between all these all these people. 5:56 She'll foster an environment of innovation by encouraging the people on the team to think creatively and expansively. Come up with new ideas for how we can run this loyalty program. 6:06 And then finally she'll lead by empathy by recognizing the strengths and motivations of each team member and providing support as necessary throughout the process. 6:15 So all in all leading cross-functional teams is a really important aspect of a PM's role and in this lesson hopefully you got a better understanding of how to do it more effectively.","Learn how to lead cross-functional teams by defining roles, setting SMART goals, fostering communication, trust, innovation, and empathy so you can deliver projects effectively.",d8c7538b-f3d4-4117-a21c-7278db5e0b33,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Leading cross-functional teams,12.3,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:28.941383+00
81baa2bf93da4665bbd984de62f3ec58,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over managing conflict and negotiation. So as a PM, you're constantly working with different stakeholders who all have different and in their heads, they all have different priorities, different interests, different opinions and you are at the center of all these different 0:16 inputs coming to you. So, as a result, conflicts can arise and basically do all the things. Time, but it's important for PMs to manage it effectively. 0:24 So in addition, negotiation skills are essential for PMs to have to achieve their goals and objectives. So in this lesson, I'm going to go over different strategies to manage conflict and negotiation within the context of being a product manager. 0:38 So managing conflict, it is inevitable. In any product development process, but it's important to manage it constructively to minimize the negative impact that it can have on your product and on your team. 0:50 So number one, you want to identify the source of the conflict. Understand what is the root cause of this conflict? 0:56 Is it a disagreement over product features over the timeline or something? Thank you. Else. So once you actually identify what is the source of our conflict, then we can work towards finding a solution. 1:08 Next, you want to listen actively. So listen carefully to all the parties involved in the conflict. Try to understand their perspective and it's really critical and very effective to ask a lot of questions. 1:21 To clarify their concerns. Once you ask questions, you can start to break down the layers. What is in the back of their head that's driving them towards having this opinion. 1:31 So it'll help identify common ground and areas of agreement. Next, while you're doing this, you want to communicate clearly. Communicate your position clearly and objectively. 1:41 Try to avoid personal attacks or emotional reactions. You know, a good way to do this is to use data and facts to support your position. 1:50 And then finally, collaborate on the solution together. So don't just try to come up with a solution by yourself. Work together with the stakeholders involved in the conflict. 2:00 And literally because. They're involved in their collaborating. They're giving their ideas. You're gonna be able to find a solution that really satisfies and addresses everyone's concerns. 2:08 So brainstorm solutions with them and then evaluate them on feasibility and impact. And as a PM, you're in a great position to manage that. 2:17 The next is around negotiation skills. So here's some We'll be right back. So before entering a negotiation, you want to make sure you do research and prepare a strategy so know what your goals are know what the interests and priorities are as well for you as well as all of your parties around. 2:39 Also make sure you have data to back up all of your opinions. Focus on interests, not positions. So try to understand the underlying interests and motivations of the other party. 2:50 Instead of focusing on their position, you want to try to find a solution that addresses both of the interests of the people. 2:56 So a position is like a position on what we should do next. Next, not necessarily the background context of why they're interested or motivated to having that position in the first place. 3:08 The next is to be flexible. You want to be open to compromising and willing to adjust your position if necessary. 3:15 So don't get stuck on one solution or position. This is very common, especially for younger PMs. They may get really ingrained that one way is the best way to do it, but if they have different stakeholders disagreeing, you know, it may be easy for them to dig their, their heels in, but you do want 3:32 to be flexible and open to compromising when possible. Again, use active listening. Ask those questions. Really listen carefully. It'll help you understand the interests and, and motivators in the back of their head. 3:46 And then finally, building relationships. So negotiation is not, no negotiation, excuse me, it's not about just getting what you want. 3:53 It's about building relationships with the other party. So look for opportunities to build rapport and establish trust throughout this negotiation. 4:02 Process. All right, I'll see you in lesson 12.5.","Learn how to manage stakeholder conflict and negotiate by identifying root causes, listening actively, and collaborating on solutions so you can align priorities and move product decisions forward.",5f8983fc-4311-4df1-ae43-f6be967b5191,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Managing conflict and negotiation,12.4,TRUE,5,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:29.363889+00
10089b41451144acb4e9a003f176d013,"0:00 In this lesson I'm going to go over influencing without authority. So as a PM it's not always guaranteed that you'll have authority to direct or, or lead a team directly, especially if you're working cross-functionally or with external partners. 0:13 But you still need to influence these stakeholders to gain support for your product or project that you're working on. And so it's in this lesson I'm going to go over a couple strategies for influencing without authority. 0:25 So number one is around building strong relationships. So one of the most effective ways to influence without authority is to build a strong relationship with the stakeholder that you're trying to influence. 0:37 You want to get them to trust you. So it involves actively listening to the needs and concerns and providing support when needed. 0:44 You also want to show an interest in their work as well. So by building this trust and rapport you can position yourself as a valuable collaborator and someone whose opinion and input is respected. 0:56 So an example here a PM may be working with a dev team to build a new feature. She spends time getting to know each of the team members and their work and takes a proactive approach to addressing any concerns or challenges that come up during the dev process. 1:10 So as a result the team is more responsive to her requests and suggestions and is more invested in the success of the project because she took the time to actually address the concerns that they were dealing with. 1:21 Next, providing value. So another way to influence stakeholders is to provide value directly to them. This can come in the form of different information, sharing information with them, resources, giving them resources to do something or other support that helps them to achieve their own goals. 1:38 So when stakeholders see that you're invested in success they're more likely to be invested in yours. So an example here is a PM who may be working with a marketing team to promote a new product launch. 1:50 She provides the marketing team with detailed customer insights and product info that can be used to create these effective campaigns. 1:58 So this demonstrates to that marketing person you know, the PM understands their needs and goals. The you know, she's positioning herself as a valuable partner in the launch process. 2:09 So she's going that extra step to make sure that she is there for the marketing person. The marketing person can therefore trust her in in response. 2:19 The next is building coalition. So another strategy for influencing without authority is to build coalitions of stakeholders who share a common goal or interest and kind of agree with you. 2:29 So by bringing together a diverse group of people and organizations, you can create a more powerful and persuasive force. So this requires really strong communication skills and the ability to bring people together around a shared vision. 2:44 So an example here is that a PM may be working on a new product that requires input from multiple different departments like the engineering dev team, the marketing team, the sales team. 2:54 The PM brings together a cross-functional team to collaborate on this project. They use strong communication skills to align everyone around this shared vision and she helps ensure that the product meets the needs of all stakeholders and that is successful in the market. 3:11 The next is demonstrating expertise. So one way to gain influence without having direct authority is to demonstrate that you actually have skills in this area. 3:20 You can do this through presentations. Workshops or other opportunities to kind of flex and share your knowledge with stakeholders. So when, when the stakeholders end up seeing you as a subject matter expert or SME, they're more likely to value your input and then seek your advice and guidance on 3:37 future projects. So an example here is a PM who is working on a new product that involves complex data analysis. 3:44 So she presents her complex data findings at a company-wide meeting demonstrating that she has expertise in this area. So it helps build credibility and influence on the organization. 3:55 It ensures that her data-driven recommendations are actually taken seriously in the future. The next is focusing on outcome. So finally, it's important to make sure you are focusing on outcomes rather than just processes or procedures or outputs. 4:10 By focusing on the desired end result, you can help stakeholders see the value of the product or project that you're trying to drive forward and gain their support with it. 4:19 So it requires a strong understanding of the customer. The marketing needs, you'll always want to bring things back to the customer and what they need and then the ability to translate those needs into goals and objectives for your team. 4:32 As a PM, as an example, as a PM who is working on a new product that addresses a key customer pain point, she focuses on communicating the impact of the product. 4:42 On the overall customer experience, rather than just saying the features and functionality that we're going to be building, she's actually laying out and communicating in a clear and concise way how we will impact that person, the real person at the end of our software. 4:57 So it helps stakeholders to see the value of the product and gain buy-in for the product. Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to influence stakeholders without authority using relationships, value, coalitions, expertise, and outcome focus so you can gain cross-functional buy-in for your product.",6bfa1982-dbf3-48f5-8d15-e2362de0e4e3,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Influencing without authority,12.5,TRUE,6,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:29.804663+00
02c32d0d56a245338f80f7c954f2a9b9,"0:00 Welcome to Module 13. This is around building a successful product management career. And in the first lesson we're going to go over key skills and competencies for product managers to have. 0:11 So a PM is a really dynamic role. It requires a broad range of skills and competencies. And in order to be successful as a PM, you need to understand the needs of the customer and the market. 0:22 You need to work well with cross-functional teams and you need to make data-driven decisions amongst other things. So in this lesson I'm going to dive into some of these key skills and competencies that you should have and build over time get better and better. 0:35 So the first one here is market research and customer analysis. PMs need to be able to understand the needs and wants of their customers as well as the broader market in which their product is actually operating in. 0:47 So this means you need to be good at market research, analyzing data, getting insights about customer behavior in their preferences. 0:54 By developing a deep understanding of the market overall, PMs can make more informed decisions about their strategy and the development efforts they have. 1:26 The next is around strategic thinking and planning. So PMs need to be able to develop and execute a strategic plan for their products. 1:36 It requires them to think creatively and strategically to develop a roadmap. A roadmap based on that and everything should align to the broader organizational goals that your leadership and executive team have mapped out. 1:48 PMs also need to be able to prioritize initiatives and make trade-offs within them to ensure their products are meeting business objectives. 1:56 So an example here is a PM and a retail company who develops a strategy for a new product line. They, they may identify key market opportunities and develop a roadmap for developing the products within that line and then ultimately launching. 2:10 The next is around cross-functional collaboration. So PMs need to work closely with cross-functional teams like engineering, design, marketing, and sales to name a few. 2:21 Another big one. So in order to be successful, they need to be able to communicate effectively with those team members from different backgrounds and disciplines. 2:29 They're going to be the ones translating the roadmap, the technical decisions to those other teams. So it requires strong interpersonal skills and the ability to build and maintain relationships over time. 2:41 An example here is a PM at a tech company who works closely with the engineers to develop a new feature or product. 2:47 She collaborates with the design team as well to ensure that the feature is visually appealing and easy to use. And then she works with the marketing team to develop messaging and go-to-market plans for that launch. 2:58 So as you see, the PM is in the center of all those different collaborations. A huge one is data analysis and then decision making. 3:12 So, PMs need to be able to make data-driven decisions based on a deep understanding of the customer and the market and, you know, your product offering and everything else. 3:22 It requires the ability to analyze and interpret the data to develop insights based on it that you can, you know, use to then inform product strategy and development and PMs need to be able to communicate this data effectively to stakeholders. 3:37 You want to build support for the decisions that you're driving. So, and as an example here, PM at a healthcare company may analyze data on patient outcomes and satisfaction. 3:47 They'll use this info to recommend changes to the products that will improve the patient experience overall. The next is leadership and project management. 3:56 So PMs need to be able to lead cross-functional teams and manage these complex projects from start to finish. It's, you know, you won't always have a project manager on your team or a program manager. 4:07 You know, you meet maybe the one that's leading your team and managing these projects. So it requires good, strong project management skills and the ability to motivate and inspire team members. 4:18 PMs also may need to be able to build consensus and drive a life. So if you can imagine an example here, a PM and a FinTech company may lead a cross-functional team to develop a new financial planning tool. 4:33 So she'll use her leadership and project management skills to ensure that everything is delivered on time and within budget and that all the stakeholders are aligned around the product business. 4:42 So these are just a few of the key skills and competencies that I wanted to go over that are really essential for product managers to develop, you know, to have, to, to develop, to up level over time and by doing this PM's going to be more effective in their roles, they'll be promoted you know, 5:00 their compensation is going to increase and ultimately they're going to be delivering much more value to customers and the business.","Learn how to identify the core product management skills—market research, strategy, collaboration, data-driven decisions, and leadership—so you can grow your career and deliver better products.",55cd6017-6c57-49aa-b552-758b60aa27f5,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Key skills / competencies for PMs,13.1,TRUE,6,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:30.716217+00
52594845c663415b94cb977d167c2f6b,"0:00 This next lesson is on networking and personal branding. So as a PM, building a strong professional network and personal brand can really impact your career success. 0:11 So I'm going to go over a couple different tips here to do this effectively. So you might want to attend events and conferences. 0:18 This is a big one and a lot of fun most of the time because you're, you're talking with like-minded people. 0:23 So you might attend events related to product management and you're going to meet new people and learn about the latest trends. 0:30 Be sure to have like business cards and practice introducing yourself in your background with like a 30 second elevator pitch. 0:36 The next thing you can do is join a professional organization. So this is going to allow you to help connect with like-minded professionals in product management. 0:46 So this may lead to job opportunities, mentorship, valuable industry insights, and stuff like that. The next is using social media. 0:54 So LinkedIn is probably the best tool to do this, but I'm sure there's more out there and it's going to allow you to cultivate your network. 1:00 Work in personal brand and ensure that your LinkedIn is up to date and I'll teach you that in future modules in this program and consider joining different groups engaging in discussions to build your reputation as a thought leader in the space of product management. 1:16 The next is internal kind of building relationships with colleagues. You want to build strong relationships with the other product managers within your organization, the engineers, the designers, you know, other stakeholders. 1:29 All this can lead to better collaboration and communication on projects. Take the time to actually get to know them, you know, their, their personal story, ask questions about them, engage in team building activities. 1:41 All of this makes it easier to collaborate with them in the end. Next is sharing your knowledge. So as you learn things, speak at industry events write blog posts, host webinars establish yourself as a thought leader in, in the field. 1:56 And this is just going to expand your reach as a product manager. So, you know, you may start as an associate product manager, or product manager, and then become a senior, or a staff, or a director of product over time. 2:08 So share your knowledge and expertise with the world as you learn things in your role. Finally, seek out mentorship. Finding a mentor can be really valuable as you grow as a product manager. 2:19 You'll be able to get actionable advice from someone. One who just has more experience in the field. So in conclusion, networking and personal branding is this thing that you're gonna develop over time. 2:30 It's an ongoing process. It requires consistent effort to maintain relationships and continue to build your reputation over time. So, but by taking the time to develop these skills, you can increase your visibility within the world of product management and position yourself for a long-term career success 2:47 .

77210326d0a143169e3590a081f5b7d4,"00:01 Okay, so welcome to lesson 6.2. This is going to be understanding APIs and integrations. I hope you're excited for this. 00:10 Alright, so quick overview here. In today's world, we're very interconnected. Products work with each other. They work from all different data sources. 00:20 Everything is kind of connected and intermingled. So this means that software really needs to communicate and share data across all these different applications to provide a really seamless user experience. 00:33 So APIs, application programming interfaces, and integrations play a really critical role in actually enabling this back and forth kind of communication. 00:44 So in this lesson we're going to explore what APIs are, what integrations are, and how they're actually significant to product managers. 00:52 Um, okay, so what is an API? API, that word is thrown around a lot. Um, it's, it is an important part. 01:01 Of, uh, you know, working as a product manager inside of a tech company. Uh, so it's important to really understand it. 01:07 It's called an, it's, you know, typically referred to as an API, as in it's always referred to as an API. 01:14 No one says application programming interface, but that is what it means. Um, and it's a way for applications. And systems to communicate with each other. 01:24 Uh, it really defines how requests and responses should be structured. Um, it's, it's kind of like a contract in that sense. 01:31 Um, and it really enables the application to access data or functionality from another application in a standardized and secure way. 01:41 Um, so in simple terms, an API is kind of like a middleman between two applications, allowing them to share data and interact with each other. 01:52 And so I'll go into that later. Uh, but you can think of it as kind of like this middle interface between, you know, the front end web, uh, or. 02:01 You know, mobile app experience and the database or somewhere where we're actually storing data. Okay. So I'm going to just jump right into a real world example to hopefully help you understand what an API is. 02:15 So let's consider that you want to get weather information from a weather service. So you're going to send a request to the weather services API. 02:26 They're going to process their request, get the required data, and then send it back to you in these formats. These are structured formats and I'll go into this later. 02:35 One is JSON and the other is XML. And so this code is Python and it's going, I'm going to show you, you know, each line, what each line means, but this is the code that was actually going to call the weather services API and get that data. 02:53 Okay, so I'm going to go line by line here and try to hopefully explain all this. Just one note here is that everything. 03:01 Green is a comment. Um, so I'm listing out kind of what the different lines are doing here. So the first line here, um, in this Python file is import requests. 03:13 So request is just a library that Python has, um, that helps to make HTTP HTTP requests. Or API requests. Now we're going to go and set the API base URL. 03:28 Um, so the variable API base URL is this, this URL here. Um, we're looking at the open weather map API and we're going to set this as, uh, kind of this variable and then. 03:42 And we're going to also put in our API key. So basically when a company wants to access an API from another company, they need to sign up for that other company and get a key, uh, and put that key in here so that it's defined so that when open weather map actually gets our request and the key is attached 04:03 , they can know that we are the ones that are trying to access this data. Um, they may use that for billing, security, etc. 04:11 Now, the next thing that we're going to define is the city name. So we want to understand and get the weather for New York. 04:19 So we're going to set the city to this city name. And then what we're going to do is we're going to make this a new variable called API request URL. 04:29 We're going to put these components together. Um, we're going to get this base URL. We're going to put in New York and we're going to also put in our key. 04:37 And this really just creates a URL like just the one at the top here. Um, you know, you have. Of docs.google.com, similar to API.openweathermap.org. 04:47 There's all these identifiers and things over here as well. And so what this line is doing is it's just creating a URL similar to this. 04:57 Okay. So now that we have the actual URL created, what we're going to do is. We're going to request it. 05:05 Um, so we're going to send this URL, um, and get back and tell open weather, Hey, we want all the weather information for New York. 05:14 Please send it back to us. So open weather is going to get that. They're going to find the weather and they're going to store all that data. 05:23 In this response. Now the weather app is going to send back a status. So if the status code of the response is 200, that means that we are all good. 05:38 We're good to go. They were able to process it and they were able to give it back to us. This is kind of like a green light. 05:44 And what we're going to do then is we're going to assign the response JSON, which I went over in the in the previous slide. 05:53 Um, right here, we're going to assign that to weather data. And then what we're going to do is we're going to just print these two statements here. 06:03 Um, and you know, this, this example doesn't do much, but what it does do is it says it prints out to the end user weather data for it's going to take the city name again up here, New York, uh, and it's sending a new colon and then it's going to print out the weather data for that end user. 06:21 Um, so this really small. Program here is a complete program in the sense that it can take a city, it can request the data for that city and then it can print it out to the user. 06:34 Now, um, when, uh, what we see here and we'll go into this later is if the code is not 200, maybe it's 502. 06:43 Um, that means that the API had an issue and could not actually return data. So what we're in, we're gonna do in that case is that we're gonna print this line and error occurred while fetching the weather data. 06:57 So basically what we're doing here again is we're generating an API request based on a couple of these different variables here. 07:06 We are sending their request to this third party. We're getting it back and storing it. And then we're doing something with it. 07:15 We're printing it out to the user. Hopefully this makes sense. I'll go into more as well. So this is actually what an ex- sample, um, looks like of what will get back from open weather. 07:29 So it's gonna be in this. This is Jason format and you can see various pieces of data like the coordinates, the temperature, etc. 07:37 So just to go line by line here. Um, so this is the response that we get back from open weather and. 07:44 And it's what we're storing in this field right here response. So we see the coordinates are negative 122, 37. And we then see below the weather for those coordinates. 07:59 So what it did is it took New York or San Francisco and it actually identity. Intified what the coordinates were and now it's sending back what the weather is for that location. 08:10 So right now it has these two descriptions here. So Maine is clouds. Um, the description is broken clouds. And there's also an icon. 08:21 So we internally, if we're trying to. Display this we might look to see. Okay, like, um, what is Maine say? 08:29 Does Maine say clouds? If so, let's show a cloud icon to the user. Um, down here we have temperature feels like the minute max of the day. 08:40 Um, and so we may need to convert these into, um. Fahrenheit or, or Celsius based on who our users are and what their preferences are. 08:50 If we go over to this side, the wind, we see that the speed is 3.6. Uh, based on open weathers API, this may be miles per hour, maybe something else. 09:01 Um, and so basically what ends up happening is. You know, every company, every feature is interacting with these APIs. They're, they're requesting data from some place and then they're getting it back typically in this format. 09:16 And then they're looking through this data and actually doing something with it. They're, with it. They're displaying it to the end user. 09:23 Okay. So to. I'm going to go back and drive into that. Uh, this is an example of HTML, which you probably are more familiar with. 09:31 This is a way to actually display and, and create web pages. So just to go through here, I'm just going to go quickly. 09:40 Um, what it's doing is it's setting the title similar to module six up here of this web page. To say weather app, then in the body section. 09:48 So, you know, over here, it's saying we want a h one header text to say weather in San Francisco. And then in a paragraph, uh, text below, we want to say current weather. 10:01 And then we're going to, we're going to use the weather description. Um, and so this. This is going to say broken clouds. 10:08 So weather in San Francisco, current weather broken clouds. Um, so now we've been able to take this data that we requested from open weather and actually display it to the user and put it on the web page. 10:20 Um, which I think is really exciting. And that's kind of the foundation of how. And API works and how, um, software actually gets the data and displays it to users. 10:33 So another major concept here is what we call databases. So it's a structured collection of data that can be accessed, managed and updated. 10:44 So you can really think of it. Similar. So what I wrote to how I have it here is a giant spreadsheet with different columns and rows. 10:51 And each row represents a new record. Uh, each column represents an attribute of that record. So I'll go over this really quickly. 11:00 So we have the orders table here or the orders database. And we have. The following columns, order ID, customer name, product, price and quantity. 11:12 So as you can tell, this table is really looking at the list of orders that we as a company have received. 11:20 Um, and it looks like this is for a coffee company. Uh, maybe Starbucks. This is my. Actual order. I love cold brew. 11:28 So what we do is we set an ID and this goes up by one every time. So every time we get a new order, we just increment that by one. 11:38 So the next one on here would have been five. Uh, then in the customer name field, we're saying who actually bought the, uh, you know, who is the purchaser? 11:47 Of this order. So in this case, he was myself. Okay. What is the product that Anthony bought? It's a cold brew. 11:54 And how much did that one cold brew cost? Um, for 99. And what is the quantity? How many did Anthony actually get? 12:02 It's one. So we're saving. We're storing all this information as one record. In this table. And every time we have a new order, we just create another row. 12:12 And you can really think about this exactly like a spread sheet works. There's the column, you know, the columns and the rows are a new representation or record of something that has occurred. 12:25 And so what ends up happening is. Um, you know, maybe I'll have, we'll have an app or a website that is displaying the, the orders from the particular coffee app. 12:38 And so we'll look up who ordered, you know, what did Anthony order? He got a cold brew and it was $4.99. 12:44 So we're going to display that to Anthony on the. So just to go through an example here, um, so for any commerce company, a database could store all this information about the customers products, shipping addresses, etc. 13:02 And this data is really then used by the company's software to perform a variety of different. And so the API is kind of this intermediary between this database here and the different applications that need access to that data. 13:27 And so, uh, So when an app needs to retrieve or update information, it sends a request to the API and then that API communicates with the database on behalf of the application. 13:39 Um, so, for example, let's say that a customer wanted to view their order history on this ecommerce website. So when the customer logs in, they'll. 13:48 Okay, my email is this, my password is this, they're going to log in and they're going to click order history. 13:54 So the website's front end application is an ascend request to the API and it's going to ask for the order details associated with that customer's account. 14:05 So then it's going to take that API is going to go to the database. It's going to find it. It's going to get all that data and it's an ascend it back, um, in that structured format that we showed before. 14:16 Then the application is going to display this order history to the customer in a really user friendly way, like a table or a list. 14:24 So to demonstrate this as if the front end and back end where people. And, and just to be clear, what the front end is, is what you're looking at right now. 14:34 Um, it's the front experience of software. It's what users actually see and click. Whereas the back end is kind of the systems in the background, um, that are managing the data and they're getting this data moved all back and forth. 14:49 And so, in this example, um, for, for our data, uh, our table here, what we're going to do is the front end, say we're logging into Starbucks.com, whatever. 15:01 Uh, we can say, hey, back end, user Anthony S, the ID is 4314. They're logged in. And they're trying to access their orders page. 15:12 Can you please give me the information for Anthony? So that's number one here. Um, number one is saying, here's the website. 15:20 We're saying, hey, back end, please give me all the data for Anthony. Now the API is going to go to the database. 15:27 And now they're going to look. Get up. Uh, they're going to look up and they're going to find, okay, Anthony is ID 4314. 15:35 So you're going to find, uh, 4314 in the orders table. They're going to get all that data. They're going to put it into that JSON that I showed before. 15:44 And then they're going to send it back. So the back in here says, sure, that's super easy. I found one order where the customer ID is equal to 4314. 15:54 So here it is in a structured format. So the front end now, now we're over here is saying, going to say, thank you for this structured format that we agreed on. 16:04 I see Anthony got a cold brew for 499. So I'm going to display that to the user now. So now it takes that data and presents it in a nice visual way for that end user. 16:16 Okay. So now that you kind of have an understanding of APIs and how they work, how the data flows, I wanted to clarify that there are a couple different types of APIs and they each serve different purposes. 16:29 So. Oh, uh, there are web APIs and these are by far the most common. They use protocols like HTTP and HTTP S to communicate between different apps. 16:40 And again, they're the most common type of API that integrates different web services and mobile apps, um, between, you know, the data. 16:50 That your company has and showing that back and forth, but also third parties, um, which we'll go into later. So the next is library and framework APIs. 17:00 These give, uh, companies and teams access to pre-built functionality in programming languages and frameworks. And this allows developers to. Really more quickly implement features without having to write everything from scratch. 17:16 Um, so an example here is you may have a framework, um, that easily turns JSON data into something more manageable, or you may have, um, a framework that formats. 17:31 So you don't have to, you know, write custom code to figure out time zone and how to display a date and time to a user. 17:38 It just does it really easily for you. The next is an operating system API. So this offers access to low level system resources, enabling it to interact with the. 17:51 Operating system. So this means like if you need to turn on the camera of the app or the phone, I should say, or the computer that your software is using, you would use an operating system API to actually do that. 18:04 Um, and this kind of interfaces with hardware APIs. So say you have a kind of a blue. To device or a camera. 18:14 Um, that camera, there's going to be APIs that allow the software to work and communicate with one another, um, to get more information and have a seamless user experience. 18:26 But by far, the most common that you'll probably interface in your role are these web a. Okay, so one thing to mention is that APIs can have kind of different data formats, um, to facilitate this communication. 18:42 The most common that you'll typically see is rest representation representational state transfer. And this is typically using JSON as the data. 18:52 So you may hear rest API. And so this is again, uh, that JSON where it's very easy to understand. Okay, we have our data here and within the data, there's temperature and it's 72.5. 19:04 Um, the other is XML. This is what this looks like. It's a little bit harder to visually see, uh, but that's just another. 19:12 Format in which the data can come back, uh, when you're using a soap API. Okay. So what are integrations? Integrations are really connections between different software applications that allow them to work together and share data. 19:28 Uh, APIs enable these integrations because they. It provide a very standardized interface for communicating. Um, when a company creates an integration, they are agreeing to exist an exact way that the data is going to be communicated back and forth. 19:46 That way both both the person, you know, the company or software that's requesting it and. The one receiving that request. 19:54 They're speaking the same language. So they're expecting, you know, a city name. Um, so we know, okay, we want weather data. 20:03 So we're going to send New York open weather is expecting New York. Um, so it's kind of a contract between these true two and. 20:13 And integrations can really help, um, in general to streamline workflows, automate processes and enhance the overall user experience and API's are what enables that to actually happen. 20:25 So what is the importance of API's and integrations and product? Um, as a PM, it's really important. And to understand API's for a couple of reasons. 20:36 One is just collaborating with your engineers, the tech teams. Um, it helps PM's more effectively communicate with stakeholders and ensure that product requirements are clearly defined. 20:48 Um, because knowing how the API and the data is structured. Will allow you to make more informed decisions. You can have more intelligent conversations. 20:58 Um, so if the engineer says, Hey, like our API doesn't, um, you know, send back temperature right now, you could, you know, you can understand what that means and you can work to prioritize getting temperature sent back. 21:12 Um, the next is a. Around product planning and strategy. So understanding how APIs and integrations can benefit your product will allow you to make better decisions about what features to prioritize and when. 21:26 Sometimes third party services may take a lot more time and complexity to actually integrate with. Versus another third party or just building it from scratch. 21:37 So it's important to understand APIs and their their you know how they. Interplay with these decisions and then the third is around the user experience so. 21:46 Integrations in general can really enhance the UX by connecting your product with another application that you're. Users already know and love so you know mail chimp is a great example. 22:00 Mailchimp is a way for people to send out emails. So if you have another software where you're managing contact information and you want to sync that contact over to Mailchimp that would be considered an integration and you can use an API to accomplish that. 22:14 And it's important at least that you know as a product manager that that exists. It's a possibility because it really can expand and enhance the ultimate user experience that your users, uh, receive. 22:27 Okay, so a quick example of an integration. Imagine you're building some type of project management app. And you want to integrate it with a popular calendar app like Google Calendar, which most people use. 22:40 So what you're going to be able to do to achieve this integration is that you use the Google Calendar API. 22:47 And that's going to give you access and give your application access to create, modify and delete calendar events on behalf of the company. 22:55 So what it's going to do is it's going to say, okay, we have this upcoming stakeholder meeting and we're managing that in our project management app. 23:06 And it's going to automatically with the software create an event on behalf of the user for that stakeholder meeting. So, um, you know, in this example, the integration would provide your users with the ability to see project tests, deadlines directly within their calendar, um, as opposed to having to 23:25 log back into your app every single time they want to know information about it. Okay, so in summary, uh, APIs and integrations are very essential. 23:35 Um, parts of the modern software development process. They enable applications to work together very seamlessly. And so as a PM, understanding these concepts will help you make a lot better decisions when it comes to your strategy. 23:50 It'll really allow you to more effectively communicate with the engineers on your team. And ultimately, if you can really leverage this technology, you can deliver a superior user experience. 24:03 Um, you really are able to use APIs to get data, um, into the hands of users. So I hope that makes sense. 24:11 And I will see you in the next lesson. Thanks.",Learn how APIs enable integrations by structuring requests and responses between apps and databases so you can plan features and collaborate effectively with engineers.,ebfe0fed-2db3-4971-823a-fd06bcb94215,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Understanding APIs and integrations,6.2,TRUE,25,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:42.797864+00
f0bc763b8fda4270bbe19bfc2481409c,"00:01 Cool, welcome to lesson 6.3. In this lesson, I'm going to go over basic programming concepts. So, um, as a PM, it's good to have a basic understanding of these concepts because you'll be able to more effectively communicate with your engineers at your dev team. 00:18 Uh, this is going to allow you to make better decisions ultimately about the technical aspects of your product. So in this lesson, I'm going to cover some fundamental concepts that every PM should hopefully be familiar with. 00:31 Okay, so to start out, uh, we have variables and data types. So what is a variable? I kind of went over this in the API lesson, but a variable is a container that stores a value. 00:43 So it acts as a placeholder holding data that can change or be manipulated over time as the program or the software is executed. 00:53 So an example here would be car name. Car name is a variable. And in this instant instance, we're setting it to Subaru Forester. 01:03 So our name starts out, it's a variable and we're setting it to Subaru Forester. So the next time the program wants to get the name of the car, we say, we reference car name and it's Subaru Forester. 01:19 But now say the user wants to go in and say, hey, I got a new car. Now I have a Toyota Corolla. 01:28 So we're gonna actually take car name and re-update it. Say we're gonna say car name equals Toyota Corolla and it's gonna update the name of the car. 01:37 But car name stays the same. So it's really like this. So we're gonna say car name equals Toyota Corolla and it's gonna update the name of the car. 02:01 So any of these DRpper uh, so a string is text. 02:24 This text can be Hello World for example. Uh, Subaru Forrester is an example of a string. So it's any text, it's things that you're using characters. 02:34 And then finally we have Boolean. So these are true or false statements. Um, so a Boolean is the variable. And for example, like if we wanted to set a Boolean here, we could say like, um, has gasoline. 02:51 It could be set to true if it does have gasoline or it could be set to false if it doesn't. 02:57 Um, so that's another different data type. You could also have dates. Different types of data, but they're all stored in these variables. 03:06 Okay. So the next is functions and methods. So a function is a block of code and it's really designed to perform a specific task. 03:17 They're reusable. So they can be reused and used over and over again. And multiple times within a program. And an example is a function we call greet. 03:28 So this takes an argument, uh, right there. That's what we would call an argument and it's called a name. And then it returns a message. 03:39 Um, so we call the function. Um, so let's just go through this actually. So we're defining greet as taking name and then we're returning. 03:49 We're going to say hello, comma. We end the string there and we do plus name. So the name variable here is being used here. 04:00 And then we're also. Adding an exclamation point. So now later on in the program, we say we're going to set a name, the variable name to a string, John, and we're going to set the message variable to calling this greet function with the name. 04:20 So we're going to say greet. John. Now we're going to go up here. The code is going to find this function. 04:26 They're going to say, okay, cool. Name has been given to us as John, and we are going to now return to the message. 04:34 Hello, comma plus John. So eventually we're going to print this message to the user, and the output is hello, comma. 04:42 John, exclamation point. And so this right here, greet, is an example of a function. It takes different data in and then it spits back out a result. 04:52 A method is very similar, but it's associated with an object or class, and I'll go over that in a sec. 05:00 So the next thing I wanted to go over is conditional statements, very frequently referred to as if statements. So these statements are used to make decisions in the code. 05:11 It allows the program to take different paths depending on the data that it's given. A common conditional statement includes if else statement. 05:23 And so in an example, we have an age variable here. It's set to 25, the integer 25. So we're going to use an if else statement to check the age and then print a message based on the ages that it's given. 05:41 So if it's less than eight. We want it to say something. It's if it's between 1864, we want to say something. 05:47 So I'm going to go through this quickly. So we have the variable age here. It's set to 25. If the age is less than 18, we're going to want it to print you are a minor. 05:58 25, however, is not less than 18. So in this instance, we go on. To the next check and we're saying else if okay, so it wasn't that. 06:09 Otherwise, is it less than 65? In this instance. Yes, it is 25 is less than 65. So we're going to actually print you are an adult and then leave this if statement. 06:21 It's not going to go to the else. And print you are a senior citizen. Um, now if the, the user was 90 and we go through this if statement, 90 is not less than 18. 06:34 90 is also not less than 65. So in all other cases, we're going to say you are a senior citizen. 06:40 So these ifs else statements are very commonly. We're going to use in our license by placing a ship event in the Gettingstar Bar tag tag that is still symbolized. 06:52 Okay, so now we have, um. Loops are pretty fun to think about, and they can be a little bit confusing, but hopefully you'll be able to understand. 07:01 So there, whoops, okay. Okay, so they're used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. 07:13 Um, so this may be commonly referred to as like a for loop or a while loop. Um, and we have an example here with a shopping cart. 07:21 It has items, prices, and quantities, and the for- loop is gonna go through each item in the cart array, and it's gonna tally them up to figure it out at total price. 07:30 So I'm gonna go line by line here and explain exactly what is happening. So right here we have a shopping cart variable. 07:38 And this is gonna be storing a couple different items in a list. So that is- that's not only referred to as an array, and we see we have three items here. 07:49 So we have an apple. The price of that apple is 50 cents, and the quantity that we have in our shopping cart right now is 4. 07:57 Now the next item is a banana. And the price of that is 20 cents. And the quantity we have- of 10 bananas in our shopping cart. 08:06 And finally, oranges are 30 cents and we have six. So now we want this for loop to actually determine the total price in our shopping cart. 08:17 So we start with setting the total price to zero. We just want to set that as the beginning value. Uh, because a shopping cart, you know, total cost starts at zero. 08:29 So now what we're going to do is we're going to enter this for loop. Now the for loop only has two lines here, but we're going to say for every item in the shopping cart, we want to do these two things. 08:41 So what that means is for item in shopping cart. So it's going to go for this item, for this item, for this item, until it gets to the end of the shopping cart, and then it will leave this, this for loop. 08:55 And it's doing two things. So it's, it's, we have this item total variable here. And what we're doing is we're setting it to the item price times the item. 09:05 So what it's basically doing is we're going to say item total equals the price of the first item. So that's 50 cents times four. 09:16 So that comes out to two dollars. And so the item total for apple is two dollars. And then what we're going to do is we're going to do. 09:25 Add that item total to the total price. So that's what plus equals means means added here. And another way that this could be represented is total price equals total price plus item total. 09:41 But Python makes it easy and just says plus equals item total. And so we went from zero dollars to then adding that two dollars for the apple. 09:51 So now we're up to two dollars. Okay, so then what we do is we go to the second item in the list, the banana. 09:59 So now we're saying, okay, the item total again is, uh, it's twenty. So that comes out to another two dollars. 10:09 Total price is already two dollars and now we're going to add on the cost of the banana. Um, and it's going to become four dollars. 10:16 So we're up to four dollars here. Um, so we do the same again for orange and then we ultimately leave this for loop and then print out the state. 10:25 The total price of items in the shopping cart, colon dollar sign is this, maybe, you know, three dollars, four dollars. 10:34 Um, and so that represents a kind of repeated action that it does a number of times until the condition is met. 10:42 The condition being for every item in the shopping cart. So it'll go through this three times to tally up all the total prices within that shopping cart. 10:53 Okay. So the next thing I want to go over is object oriented programming. So it's a paradigm in code that organizes things into objects and classes. 11:05 And this. It just thinks it just easier to manage applications. So classes are blueprints for creating objects out of them. 11:13 Uh, it in the class, they define the attributes and methods that the objects will have. So to use an example to make this clear to understand, we can define a car class. 11:26 And within that car, there's different attributes about the car. And this really represents the real world. These classes should kind of represent what's happening in the world. 11:35 So we have make model here color and speed. Let me also have methods. Okay, so to go up here, um, what we're saying here is that we have this class car and we're. 11:46 We're defining it to have a couple of these different inputs here. And so we are setting the make, uh, the model, the year, the color and the speed to zero just to start. 11:59 And so when later on, when we actually create a car, which is an object, it's storing the. This, um, as the car attributes. 12:09 Now here, uh, we have methods. And so these are very similar to functions, uh, but they apply specifically to the car object that's being created. 12:21 And so what we're going to do in this example is we're going to have these three. Methods within the class car, and they're going to do different things. 12:31 So if we want to accelerate the car, we're going to take the speed that it's given, which is zero. It starts at zero. 12:39 We're going to add five to it. Okay, so now we're going five and say we want to accelerate it again. 12:45 Um, so we, we. We'd say to accelerate and it will add another five. So now we're up to 10 miles per hour. 12:51 Uh, then we want to break. So we call break and break just reduces it by five. And maybe there's a red light. 12:59 So we want to stop completely. So we break one more time and it brings the speed that back down to zero. 13:05 So these are two different. Methods within the car class. And then finally, uh, for honking, all this does is it prints out Hong Kong. 13:15 And so all these combine add up to this class of car. Now, objects are kind of instances of these classes. 13:26 They represent. And then real world entities with different attributes and behaviors. And so in this example, we're going to create a car and we're going to do certain things to it. 13:35 Okay, so we're going to set the variable my car is equal to this car class using Toyota Camry, the year 2015, which is an integer. 13:47 And the color is silver. Okay, so then what we're going to do is we just want to print this back out to the user, maybe in the UI. 13:55 And so what we're going to do is we're going to say we want to print make colon. And it's going to look at that my car. 14:04 It's going to go to the make. Inside. And the make as we see here is that first item. So so Toyota. 14:13 And so what it's going to print out is saying make Toyota. And then model, Camry, year 2015 color silver. And so what it's essentially doing is referencing the values. 14:26 Uh, inside. And my car based on this car class. Okay, so now we say we want my car to accelerate and remember we started speed zero. 14:38 And so when we call this, it's going to go up to five. So when we print speed after acceleration, it's going to print. 14:46 Uh, sorry, when we do. We accelerate, it's an apparent speed after accelerating five. Now we want to slow it down. 14:52 So we, we call break and it comes here and says, okay, we're going to take the speed that it currently is and subtract five. 15:00 So speed after breaking is now zero. Uh, and then finally we're going to hunk the horn of the car. So my car. 15:08 It's going to go look at this method and it's going to print hunk, hunk out to the user. So the user ultimately is in a C one, two, three, four, five, six, seven statements in their user interface outlining the make model, your color of the car, as well as the speed after doing. 15:28 So, we're going to be doing certain accelerations and breaks and then finally, uh, the fact that it humped. Okay, so finally here we have a version control system. 15:38 So GitHub is a really popular one. Um, and it really helps teams manage and collaborate on code by tracking changes and enabling the merging of. 15:50 So basically what engineers will do is they will have their set of code and it'll be stored in something called master. 15:58 And so what they want to do is they want to create a new branch off of that. And in that branch, they're going to update the code. 16:05 And so in this example, they're they're deleting. This line enabled equals, et cetera, and they're adding these green lines. And so what ends up happening is they will change the code. 16:17 They'll update it based on the feature that you want them to be working on. And they'll create this new branch out of it. 16:24 And put it up for review. And other engineers will take a look. And they'll actually comment back and forth with the engineers saying, you know what, I don't know if this line here is necessary or I think we can do this a little bit differently. 16:39 And so they're going to get feedback on that pull request or merge request. And that is based off of the changes that the that the engineer is actually. 16:48 And so the idea with this is that you don't want to just be making changes directly to master because at tech companies, lots of people are working at once on the code. 17:00 You want to create these separate branches that they can make their changes in and then ultimately after it's been approved by one. 17:08 Or a couple engineers based on feedback, then what they do is they merge their branch back into that master. And then when everything is tested and ready, we actually deploy master to production. 17:24 Um, and that means we're saying, okay, we want all the code right now and master. To be deployed so that the end user is using the website or using the app, see the new version, the new updated version of master that has this branch has this updated code in it. 17:41 Um, so version control systems are really, really critical in the development process. And that's something that you'll come into when working with. 17:50 Okay, so in conclusion, understanding these concepts is really going to help you bridge the gap between the technical and non technical aspects of product management. 18:01 Um, you're going to be more equipped to better understand what your engineers are talking about. And you're going to be able to speak that commonly. 18:09 And so if you're really interested in this and you want to learn more, I recommend going to Code Academy. Uh, you can, you do these free lessons that really dive into these concepts and actually have you doing them coding typing them out, running these little programs. 18:25 And it helps you to learn these concepts. But I think in general, as long as you're understand the concepts outlined in this presentation, as well as the API presentation, you'll be able to pretty effectively communicate with the engineers on your team and have a good foundation of knowledge so that 18:43 you can be effective as a PM. So I hope that helps. I will see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to explain core programming concepts like variables, functions, conditionals, loops, OOP, and version control so you can communicate effectively with engineers and make technical product decisions.",158aa5f7-377b-4633-97b9-b3ce749bdb7d,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Basic programming concepts,6.3,TRUE,19,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:43.225845+00
9c60514905ba4be9acd74acc2c01b0c3,"00:01 Hey everyone, in lesson 6.4, I'm going to go over working with dev teams. So kind of an overview of this lesson is that PMs really play a critical role bridging the gap between what the business needs and the actual technical implementation. 00:18 Understanding how to work, with your dev team is really essential for PMs to make sure that the vision of the company, of your team, of your product is actually accurately translated into that final product. 00:31 Um, so, um, in this lesson, I'm going to discuss different strategies and also best practices for PMs when they're actually collaborating with the engineers on their team. 00:40 Okay. So, um, to dive right in, the first is around establishing clear lines of communication. So you want to keep an open and transparent line of communication between yourself and the engineers. 00:53 So this includes regularly scheduled meetings like standups or sprint reviews so that you can really facilitate constant consistent updates and discussions. 01:03 Um, daily standups, as I mentioned in a previous lesson, are a good way to keep everyone in the loop around what is going on, what are people working on, and finding out about blockers that are cropping up that can slow the team down and prevent them from actually really making progress. 01:21 So, you want to identify those blockers in standups, and from there, be able to actually unblock the engineer. So, find out what they need, whether it's something from you, the designer, another team, another part of the business. 01:34 It's your job at the end of the day to make sure that they are unblocked and have everything they need. 01:44 So, understanding the technical terms as we went over in this module and concepts allows you to really more effectively communicate with them. 01:53 Because they are really in the weeds with the code, with the technical side of things. Every day, all day, they're coding, they're thinking about the tech and technical implementation of things. 02:03 So, they're naturally going to gravitate towards talking in a more technical manner. And so, as long as you understand some of these technical concepts that I went over in the lessons, you'll be able to communicate back and forth with them. 02:15 So, a couple examples here are talking to you like front end versus back end development or the concept of API. 02:21 And again, we've gone over these, but to reiterate the front end, that's like what is the user is actually seeing. 02:28 Um, there's front end developers and those are the ones that, for example, would work on a user interface like this. 02:35 And then there's back end developers. Those are working on the API and the databases and tables. They're working on stuff that the user actually can't see. 02:45 And, uh, you know, these, these engineers are working together in tandem, um, to, to really create an end result. You also have full stack engineers. 02:54 So those are engineers who do both front end and back end development. Uh, the third here is around fostering a collaborative. 03:02 So you really want to encourage open discussions on your team, brainstorm sessions, uh, knowledge sharing. You don't, you never want to be kind of the, the only one who's making decisions by yourself. 03:14 Um, you're not telling anyone anything. They don't understand the business context. It's really important that you create this kind of collaborative. 03:24 And so you want to encourage open discussions on your team. 03:39 Um, and so you want to encourage a collaborative environment here is you could organize a workshop or a meeting where everyone can express and share their expertise and insights. 03:53 Um, this is going to promote a stronger sense of unity and understanding on your team and, and your engineers will really, really appreciate you for this. 04:01 I've had many engineers. Thank me for just telling them like what is going on in the business? What are the priorities? 04:07 Why? How are we making certain decisions? They just want to know these things. And so if you're communicative and collaborative and open to them, they'll really appreciate you for it. 04:17 Okay. Uh, the next slide is around defining and prioritizing tasks. So. It's really important that when you're working on a project or a feature that you work with the engineers to break things down into very small tasks. 04:33 You want the engineers to be able to work on smaller, manageable tasks as opposed to just trying to do everything all at once. 04:40 And the reason for this is that. The engineers can break it up so multiple engineers can work on it at a given time. 04:47 And you can consistently show progress throughout the feature development. So an example of how you could work with an engineer to break down a feature into smaller tasks is if you're working on user authentication, which is basically sign up and log in. 05:03 You can break it down into smaller tasks like creating a login page, um, implementing the email and password validation. So when someone, when a user actually types in their email, you need to make sure that there is an at symbol in it. 05:16 Uh, all emails have at symbols, for example, you know, all emails are gonna be more than, you know, five, four character. 05:23 So you, you want to implement these validations. Uh, and then the third is integrating with a third party authentication service. 05:29 So maybe you're using another third party integration to manage this authentication. So that could be a distinct task. And by breaking these, uh, this project of user authentication down into smaller tasks. 05:42 So it's a lot more manageable for the engineering team. They can estimate how long it'll take to do this, this, and this, um, as opposed to user authentication, which may be more difficult, um, to get a sense of timing on. 05:55 Okay. So the second one here is around prioritization. You want to prioritize stuff based on business value, technical complexity. And dependencies. 06:05 Um, so collaborate with the engineers on your team, um, so that you really understand alongside of them, the impact on the business that a particular feature is going to have, what the feasibility is of that, um, uh, feature from a technical perspective and then other dependencies. 06:22 So our other teams. Relying on the work that you're doing or are you relying on something that another team is working on? 06:29 So an example here is prioritizing the implementation of a crucial feature that has a significant impact on user experience over a minor enhancement that only affects a small percentage of users. 06:41 You're going to obviously want to implement that crucial feature and the engineers will really appreciate you for this. Okay, next is managing and tracking progress. 06:52 So you're always going to want to use some type of project management tool. Every company does it a little bit differently, but there's tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana that help the team to track progress and assign tasks out and visualize overall for this project. 07:09 How are we tracking? What's, what's the timeline looking like? And so an example here is that you could create a Kanban board in Trello, which has like multiple lanes to do in progress and done, and it can track the status of all the tasks. 07:24 So you can do the task that your team is working on, and you can move it from to do into in progress when it started, and then from in progress to done when it's actually complete. 07:32 The next here is monitoring progress and adapting. So you want to regularly review the progress on your project. And as I mentioned in standups, identify these blockers or bottlenecks really early on. 07:44 So you can address them. And you may need to adjust plans as needed to ensure the project stays on track. 07:50 So maybe as you're going through the project, you find out that something is going to be a lot more complicated than you thought. 07:57 So maybe you decide to cut that aspect of the project from the scope and move forward without it. So. Another example here is that during a sprint review, you could find out that a particular task that you originally committed to was taking a lot of additional complexity due to technical challenges. 08:19 And so, you know, another thing that you can do in this scenario is to review your plan. And communicate out the timelines that have been changed and updated and extended. 08:31 So, uh, from this sprint review meeting, you find out that the task is taking longer. And then what you can do is you can communicate out to your manager, other teams, other stakeholders saying, Hey, we ran into this technical problem. 08:45 It's going to be an additional one and a half weeks until we launch the feature, for example. The next is around providing support and feedback. 08:53 So, uh, on the feedback side, you want to give constructive feedback throughout the development process. So, while you're doing this, you want to do it in a constructive and respectful manner. 09:03 Um, and you really want to. Focus on improvement opportunities. So an example here is that when you're reviewing a new feature implementation, you could point out different parts of it that, uh, could be enhanced while also making sure that the team knows that you really appreciate their work, uh, and 09:21 think that they've done a great job. Um, you don't want to just go into a review. View of a feature and, uh, kind of just simply point out everything wrong with it. 09:29 You want to acknowledge them and thank them for the work and then say, Hey, I think we can tweak this a little bit. 09:35 I think we can move this over a little to make it better for the user and always kind of tie it back to the user. 09:41 Uh, because ultimately that's obviously who's using it. So you want to build empathy with the engineers on your team. And so if they do something a little bit off, you could say, I think from a user perspective, it would be a little bit easier for them if we moved this around or adjusted this slightly 10:00 . Uh, the next is be available for support. Um, act as a resource for them. Uh, the next is be available for support. 10:26 You can provide additional context or resources or just help them out overcoming obstacles along the way. Um, the worst thing is if, you know, they're, the engineers are working on a feature and they have a question and it's preventing them from moving forward and you don't respond to their question 10:43 for four hours, you can have just wasted four hours basically that could have been unblocked if you had just responded more quickly. 10:51 So make sure you're available. Um, you know, try to avoid being in a ton of meetings so that you can actually be available to answer questions the engineers have. 10:59 And when you do, make sure you are, you know, using your context and communicating in an easy to understand. And then we're going to take a look at the understand way so that everyone is aligned. 11:09 Okay, so in summary here, working effectively with the engineers is really essential for product managers to ensure the successful implementation of their vision. 11:19 Uh, a couple of things here to highlight open communication is really important. Prioritizing the right tasks, making sure as a team you're really tracking progress in a way that everyone is aligned with. 11:32 You provide support, excuse me, to the engineers during the development process. And foundationally across all of this, you've built strong relationships with your development team. 11:43 Uh, and ultimately this allows you to drive really great. So, the goal is to make successful products in the end. 11:48 Alright, that's it for this lesson. I'll see you in the next one.","Learn how to collaborate with engineers through clear communication, task breakdown, prioritization, progress tracking, and feedback so you can deliver product features successfully.",d902ca55-4af1-4b26-aeaa-030c747ec6dc,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Working with Engineers,6.4,TRUE,12,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:43.691056+00
f1b641cea97d43c7908fe844f24c5792,"0:01 Everyone in this lesson 6.5 I'm gonna go over tech debt and it's impact on overall product development So a quick intro here ultimately strike a balance between, you want to deliver features quickly, but you also want to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability. 0:39 So in this lesson, we're going to go into these topics and how basically it impacts the ultimate product development process. 0:48 Okay, so understanding TechDead. The definition here is, TechDead is really the result of trade-offs made during the software development process. 0:58 Teams typically will prioritize speed over quality or using outdated technologies to save time and resources. An example, a quick example here, is that a team they choose to implement a feature quickly using a less optimal solution, knowing that in the future they're going to need to revisit that and 1:16 refactor it. But they did that so that they could get it more quickly out to users. And this is a typical concept that you'll see. 1:24 Companies want to move fast. They want to be able to compete. And so they're willing to make these trade-offs and write code that is not really optimal and we'll have to be changed in the future. 1:37 Some causes here. So what actually goes into creating technical debt? It can arise from a variety of different factors. One I mentioned is type deadlines. 1:47 Another is inadequate resources. So if the team was bigger or we just kind of had more time, we'd be able to invest in a better solution. 1:56 Another is around lack of documentation or changes in the requirement. So an example here is that a development team may be pressed for time because we have to reach a specific deadline. 2:07 And so they will decide to skip writing all tests for the new feature. And this means that later on the feature may start breaking. 2:15 And so tech debt is basically what we've now created by our decision to move fast and skip writing these tests, and later on, we're going to have to go back and address that at some point. 2:29 So what is the impact on TechDead? The first one is around increased maintenance costs. So as TechDead really builds up and accumulates, the cost of actually maintaining the software goes up and up, and ultimately it causes you to consume more resources and time. 2:47 An example here is that a product could be built using outdated framework, and that That doesn't require a more effort to update and maintain over the long term, and the time it takes to actually make those updates takes away from new feature development. 3:02 And so TechDead is one of those things where it, you know, creating it to move fast in the first place may be necessary, but then it always kind of comes around and, you know, hurts you in the end. 3:15 The second one here is reduced development velocity. So, if you have a lot of tech debt that builds up over time, it's in a slow down the development process. 3:25 And this means that every time you add tech debt, later on when you want to add a new feature, it's going to be even longer and more complicated to do so because the code base is riddled with all this tech debt. 3:37 So this example of how this could impact your team is that you come up with this new feature and hypothetically, it should take just two weeks, but once the engineers actually get into the code and start making changes, they see that there's a ton of tech debt that is slowing them down and causing them 3:56 to have to refactor things, and this turns a two week project into a four week project. Now, combine that and compound that over multiple different features, and you're now doubling the amount of time it's taken to update your product. 4:10 And this is what happens when companies, you know, year after year as it builds and they grow the product more and more tech debt is created. 4:19 And that's why the bigger the company, kind of the slower they can go because there's so much code, there's so much complexity as opposed to a newer team where the code is all fresh and new and they're able to move really fast. 4:33 The third impact here is generally lower code quality. So as you build up tech debt over time, it can result in the code being less quality, which means it's more difficult to maintain, more difficult for someone who is coming into that file to understand what's going on and be able to build and expand 4:53 off of it. An example here is that a complex, poorly documented code base is harder for new team members to understand and contribute to, leading to slower progress and potential errors. 5:05 So these are all the different things. Basically all this goes into the fact that it's gonna take more time to release new functionality, the more tech debt that you have. 5:18 Okay, so how do you actually manage tech debt? So the first is you wanna regularly assess it and track it. 5:25 So if you decide to skip over something out of speed, speed, you want to just immediately create a ticket in your project management tool to address that at a later stage. 5:39 You could also use tools like SonarCube or other code analysis tools that help you and help the engineers identify areas of the code base that may require refactoring or improvements in the future. 5:52 Now, the second is that you actually want to prioritize addressing tech debt. You want to allocate time and resources to address tech debt in the development schedule to minimize its long-term effects. 6:04 So what I typically see is that teams may do like an 80-20 split where 80% of the time in every two weeks is spent working on new features, new functionality, whereas 20% is addressing kind of these longer-standing tech debt items. 6:21 Now, if your team has a lot of tech debt, they may decide, you know what, for the next two weeks, we are just going to tackle tech debt. 6:29 We need to address this. But the more standard approach, more popular approach is to do kind of this split framework where 80 to 90 percent of these two weeks sprints are dedicated to new features and updating functionality, fixing bugs, and the other 10 to 20 percent are addressing tech debt. 6:48 But the third here is balancing short-term and long-term needs. So you want to make informed decisions when faced with trade-offs between what is considered a quick fix and long-term maintainability. 7:01 And an example here is that you may wait the benefits of implementing a feature quickly against the potential long-term costs of addressing the resulting tech debt. 7:11 So you may say that, okay, we could get this feature out one week faster. But if we do that, we're going to add three weeks in the future to address the tech debt that we're creating. 7:24 Or we can just spend the time now, it'll push back our release date by, you know, half a week or a full week, and we won't have created that tech debt. 7:34 So there's always these kind of trade-offs that you're needing to make and you're going to collaborate and really partner with your engineering team to make these trade-offs and decisions in an educated way. 7:45 Okay, so that was the lesson on tech debt. It's really a critical factor for PMs to at least consider in the development process. 7:54 By understanding what causes it in the first place, how it impacts the teams, and a couple of different ways to manage it, PMs can make more informed decisions that balance short-term needs, the need to get something out really fast versus long-term needs, which means maintaining the product over time 8:11 , scaling the product over time, and ultimately being super-success So that's tech debt. I hope that helps and I'll see you in the next one","Learn how to identify technical debt causes, impacts, and management strategies so you can balance fast feature delivery with long-term maintainability and development speed.",e18d63e2-fba4-46b2-96d0-91fd4764667d,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Tech debt and impact on product development,6.5,TRUE,9,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:44.150812+00
40c7f0423d9d4bde9b927a547d049ef0,"00:01 Hello, and welcome to module 7. This is going to be all about data. So the first lesson is just an introduction to data analytics. 00:10 And data analytics is the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to extract meaningful info, draw conclusions, and support decisions. 00:32 In this lesson, I'm going to go over the basics and really introduce you to data and the world of data. 00:42 So what is data analytics? A quick definition. It involves the use of various techniques and tools to analyze raw data that is tracked from our users and extract valuable insights that can help inform decisions and drive growth. 00:59 So an example here is we might want to analyze user behavior from an e-commerce website to identify trends, optimize the user experience, and increase conversion rates over time. 01:11 If you're not looking at data and how your users are actually using the platform, you're basically going to be guessing. 01:18 And guessing is one of the worst things that you can do. Okay, so what are the types of data analytics? 01:26 There's descriptive analytics, which is summarizing past data to understand what has happened. There's diagnostic analytics. So that's investigating past data to kind of do a root cause analysis, like identify the cause of specific data. 01:42 This is very, very common and important as a, as a role as the PM because you'll be owning in a specific product area and you'll have your metrics and over time those metrics are going to change. 01:56 Sometimes they may go down and or up when you want them to go down. You really need to put on your detective hat and try to identify what has happened, what changed, why are our metrics moving in the wrong direction and you're going to want to fix that. 02:12 You're going to be the one that is responsible for identifying that, figuring out the root cause with your team and working on fixing it. 02:21 Lastly, predictive analytics. This is analyzing historical data to forecast future events or trends. You may recommend actions based on this analysis. 02:31 If you see that week over week a certain metric continues to rise and rise, we may reasonably predict that that metric will continue to rise. 02:47 Importance of data analytics for PMs. We're going to fail. So you're going to want to rely on data that you are tracking to help make different decisions. 03:10 You know, you may have an idea to work on a specific feature. Say customer support has been letting you know that this is a really pressing issue for this specific type of customer. 03:21 But then when you look in the data and you see that it's only impacting 1% of the user base or 2%, you're going to, you're going to reasonably say that it's not worth the engineering effort to fix that problem when you can fix a problem that's impacting 20% of the user base as an example. 03:38 Another example here, deciding which features to prioritize. Number two, performance measurement and improvement. So tracking and analyzing product performance helps us identify areas for improvement and optimize the user experience. 04:00 So if you're looking at your funnel for example, a funnel is basically like step one, step two, step three in a user journey and you see that between step one and step two, eighty percent of users are dropping off. 04:13 That's a huge opportunity for you to say, okay, let's focus on decreasing that drop-off. We want only twenty percent of users to, to not make it to the second step. 04:25 And doing that will impact the later steps in the funnel. So this is really important for the PM's role to prioritize what, what we should be working on at any given point in time. 04:38 The next, identifying trends and opportunities. It helps PM's spot trends, uncover these opportunities and adapt to market changes. If you're doing a B2B product, for example, and you see that a certain business type say in your onboarding flow, you're asking your users to select like what 04:57 type of industry they operate in. Are they a spa? Are they consulting? Are they you know a lawn care business? 05:07 And over time, you may see that certain business, certain industries are increasing over time in terms of the ratio of users joining your product. 05:16 So you may go to the market marketing team and say, hey, I've noticed that like lawn care businesses, for whatever reason have been growing steadily like month over month. 05:26 That may be a really great area to invest our marketing into because it's shown that there's growth happening in this area. 05:35 And if we can pour gasoline onto the fire here and put some more marketing dollars into it, we may be able to really expand that out. 05:44 So looking at data and using it to identify these trends and opportunities is, is really valuable. It can, it can really help your product and really help your company overall. 05:55 So what are the fundamentals to data analytics? So there's data collection. That's gathering the raw data from various sources. It's like user interactions, logs, and third party APIs. 06:07 An example is collecting user engagement data from an analytics tool like Amplitude, Full Story, Google Analytics, or Mixpanel. So as you see on the right, here's an example of a, an event, a data analytics event that is sent to the, the product, to the company when a user is using the product. 06:28 So in this example, we can believe that this is like Spotify, for example, or any type of music playing app. 06:36 So as you see in the right over here this, this set of data is, is basically set event. The moment a a user taps to play a song in the Spotify app. 06:50 So, okay. The event is called user play song. That way the product manager and the data analyst can identify, okay, this user, user ID 12345, they started playing the song. 07:03 On May 21st and the song ID is 98765. The duration of the song is 180 seconds and they did it from a mobile device. 07:16 And here's some metadata about the song. Okay, so the genre was pop. The artist was John Doe. The album was greatest hits. 07:23 And the playlist ID is 54321. So imagine this event gets sent over and over again by thousands, tens, or in the case of Spotify, millions of users over time. 07:37 Spotify will be, or whatever company will be able to look into this data. They'll be able to set a segment on Song ID, for example. 07:45 So they'll be able to see like, what are the biggest songs being played right now? What are the most popular genres of songs? 07:53 They can look at that based on region. And they can see over time, like, how, how is this data changing? 08:02 How is it growing? Is it decreasing? What is happening? When a user plays a song, how long does it, is it between when they play a song and then they do their next action? 08:14 So data collection is really taking this raw data from your product and all this, this is not automatic, like you have to, you can intentionally add this stuff a lot of the time and then it's sent to basically your date, your company's database or a tool like amplitude or full story etcetera 08:35 and those tools then allow you to drill into this data and actually analyze it. Cleaning. So this is removing errors, inconsistencies, and duplicates from the data set to ensure accurate analysis. 08:52 So an example on the right, cancellation survey responses. This is like a raw set of data that is basically the survey responses when someone cancels a subscription. 09:04 So, you might have these three fields, ID, so the ID of the response, that's going to go up by one every time. 09:12 Then you could have the selection of the reason that they cancel. So, for example, there may be three categories, price, feature gap, and other. 09:21 And when users or select other, you may ask them to write in a note. So, in these two examples, we can see that the first two selected price. 09:31 Three and four did other, but in the notes, they said too expensive, way too much money. And this other was didn't work. 09:37 Okay, so from this, we know that actually four of the responses out of six, which is a significant amount, were actually price, even though the raw data actually just said two out of six. 09:51 And so data cleaning is basically taking a data set like this and trying to improve it to be more accurate. 09:59 So your data team or someone may might use tools to say, okay, we can reasonably believe that if they're including the word expensive or a dollar sign, let's, let's auto correct that to price. 10:16 And that way we'll be able to have more accurate data around why people are canceling their subscriptions. Okay, if four out of six search survey respondents are canceling at a price, maybe we're either pricing it too high or they're not getting enough value out of the subscription at that 10:34 price and, and we need to build additional functionality. So this is a way to take raw data, clean it, and then make decisions based on it. 10:42 Another data transformation. Converting raw data into a more suitable format for analysis like aggregating, normalizing, etc. So an example here is aggregating daily sales data into monthly totals for a high level overview of performance. 10:58 And in this case, we're using SQL. SQL is a basically a programming language or data analytically. It's a language that allows you to write these queries that then take the data, aggregate it, and display it in a certain way. 11:15 So SQL is a whole thing that you can learn. I, I dependent on whether or not your company is using SQL for their product teams, or if they're using other tools, you may want to invest in learning this. 11:30 But, just to go over this briefly in this SQL query, we have a couple different sections. So, select, the select section is basically saying, okay, I want to take and select these following data points from our raw data. 11:47 So, I want to take the year of the sale date, I want to take the month of the sale date, and I want to take the sum of the sales amount as the monthly total. 11:57 And I want to take that from the sales table. And then, I want to group by year and month. And I want to order it by year and month. 12:07 And so, what's going to return from this query is basically a table like Imagine Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel where you are basically listing out the year and month and then the total amount of sales within that given month. 12:25 And you'll be able to then see, okay, is it changing over time? Is it going up or down? How is it changing month to month, year to year? 12:33 And so, you're going from raw data sales table which is this huge data set with thousands of records that no one reasonably looking at that table can make any conclusions from it. 12:45 But this takes that data and kind of trims it down, aggregates it, and puts it into a format that is easy for us to understand as product managers so we can make decisions based on it. 12:57 Data visualization takes us one step farther. So it represents data in graphical formats like charts, graphs, to facilitate it. More understanding. 13:06 So you might run a SQL query like this and you may get this table. But just looking at the table may not be the easiest way to identify different trends. 13:17 But if you put it into a chart, you can see, whoa, between July and August we had a huge, huge bump. 13:24 This more than doubled. Our, our user base. And you then might want to say, okay, that is unexpected. But what did we ship? 13:33 What, what changed? Did we do a marketing campaign? Like, did we go viral on, on social media? What changed to double our users in that time frame? 13:44 So in conclusion, data is really, really, really important. I cannot emphasize that enough for product managers. It's really valuable to really try to understand this stuff. 13:55 And it's going to be really important in your interviews as well. It helps you make decision, it's decisions, it helps you optimize your product's performance, identify these trends and opportunities. 14:06 And by understanding the basics of data, you can really increase the likelihood of your success over time. Both the success of your product and success in your career. 14:19 I've never met a senior leader in the product management space who does not have data down. They understand it. They are the ones that are asking the right questions. 14:30 They're the ones asking for data. And they're, you know, when you're doing a product review with a leader, they're saying, well, you know, how much, what percent of the user base is this affecting, or what's the drop-off rate, or what is the average number of times that a user is doing this right now 14:48 ? They're going to be the ones that are asking those questions. And if you as a product manager, as an entry-level product manager, are able to anticipate the questions that they'll be asking, you're going to be, really excel as a product manager and be able to continue your career at a fast 15:04 pace. Okay. See you in the next lecture. Awesome.","Learn how to apply descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics with collection, cleaning, transformation, and visualization so you can make data-driven product decisions and prioritize improvements.",a64a542f-f301-4703-8777-64da77316354,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Introduction to data analytics,7.1,TRUE,16,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:44.769085+00
72a880176242427182b0cec132e81884,"00:01 Hello, and in this lesson 7.2 we're going to go over metrics and analytics for PMs. So PMs must rely on metrics and analytics to measure the performance of their product. 00:13 They need to use this to identify areas of improvement and then make those just data-driven decisions that are really critical. 00:22 So I'm going to go over in this lesson the importance of selecting the right metrics, the types of metrics commonly used by PMs, and then how to interpret and act upon the data gathered. 00:34 Okay, so starting off here, the importance of choosing the right metrics. You want to focus on what matters. Selecting the right metrics ensures that PMs concentrate on the most important aspects of their performance and user behavior. 00:47 You, once you start as a PM, or maybe you have experience close to being a product manager, you will find that there are literally dozens or hundreds of different metrics that you could track for your product. 00:58 There are a million ways that you can slice and dice your, your data, the raw data, but what's important is finding out what actually matters. 01:08 Like, in the end, how does your product area map to the success of the overall business? So I have a couple examples here. 01:17 Measuring user engagement by tracking average session duration pages per session and bounce rate. That's gonna be really critical. If you are tracking your users and you see that everyone is spending on average 10 seconds on your website or your app, that's a real problem. 01:37 They're finding no value from it and they're leaving and that may differ page by page. So that's really important to track. 01:46 Number two, monitoring revenue growth by analyzing average revenue per user, customer lifetime value and monthly recurring revenue. These are extremely critical metrics to track over time for your business, especially if you are a subscription based business. 02:03 Ultimately a business exists to make money. And you really want to make sure that you are able to increase average revenue per user over time. 02:14 That's going to be critical to your company, your product continuing to grow. Example three, evaluating user acquisition by tracking the number of new users, user referrals, and cost per acquisition. 02:26 These are a couple of really important metrics. If you're on more of a team that focuses at the top of the funnel if you can decrease your cost per acquisition, you'll be able to grow significantly faster. 02:37 If you're able to increase user referrals, so say on average one user is referring one and a half other users, you're going to grow much, much faster than if one user is only referring 0.8 users on average. 02:55 So these are really important metrics depending on your product area that you should consider tracking. You also want to avoid misleading info. 03:04 Choosing relevant and reliable metrics helps PMs avoid making decisions based on misleading data. Some examples here, looking at engagement metrics for a very small subset of the overall user base. 03:20 So we may see and say to our teams, our users play on average 12 hours of songs per day. So we should build specific features for them. 03:29 So the team would start thinking, okay, if someone is playing 12 hours of songs per day, what would be interesting for them? 03:37 Is it making playlists that are much longer than normal playlists? Is it giving them you know, updates throughout the day about you know, switching it up, switching the genre, whatever, whatever the feature may be, the team is going to start thinking and brainstorming based on this. 03:55 But what's actually accurate from this data is that 90% of our users play less than one hour of songs per day. 8% of users play between one and 12 hours per day, but only 2% of our users play more than 12 hours of songs per day. 04:13 So now, this metric is, or this statement is accurate. Our users play on average 12 hours of songs per day. 04:22 That is accurate for this subset of users. And so you want to make sure that the, the data that you are pulling and the data that you're communicating to your broader team is actually accurate and given with context. 04:36 You can also imagine like a news article for example who is in, in the article they're they're talking about a specific metric. 04:47 It's a lot of the time misleading because if you look into the context of that metric you'll actually understand at a deeper level what they're talking about. 04:56 Okay, next up types of metrics for PMs. Number one user acquisition metrics. So these are metrics that are related to attracting and bringing new users onto your product. 05:08 So a couple examples here, number of new users acquired through various marketing channels. So this is very common where you'll track the source of users. 05:17 Did they come from YouTube? Did they come from Google? Were they organic? Did they come from the app store? Did they come from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok this, or, or another method this is going to be really important to understand how this is changing over time. 05:33 Number two, organic search traffic that brings users to the product. So what are the biggest search terms that people are interested in finding out about that bring them onto your product? 05:43 Should you build specific features to address the search traffic trends that you're seeing? Cost per acquisition for each marketing campaign. 05:52 If a marketing campaign, one, say marketing campaign number one has a cost per acquisition of $5, which means it takes $5 of marketing to blast out ads to get one user onto the platform. 06:08 And you have another campaign marketing campaign number two where the cost per acquisition is $1. The second marketing campaign is obviously going to be better to invest more money in. 06:21 $5 in marketing campaign. Two, we'll get five users, whereas $5 for marketing campaign one will only get one user. But then you're going to want to look, how are those users actually using the platform? 06:33 Maybe in marketing campaign one where it's a CPA of $5, we're actually getting more qualified users and that one user is generating $5. 06:43 Creating more revenue, average revenue per user than the marketing campaign number two. You're going to want to, like these are the types of, this is the level of depth that you have to get to in your data process to understand the right metrics and decisions that you should be making. 07:03 For your product. Number two, user engagement metrics. So these are metrics that measure how users are interacting with your product. 07:11 What are they doing once they're actually in the product? So average session duration, which is like, okay on the average, say 100 users are using our product. 07:22 What is the average length? That they're staying on our product. Number two pages per session. This is like, okay, if someone comes on her website, are they an on average? 07:33 Are they looking at one page? Are they looking at two or are they looking at 10 or 20? If you can imagine Amazon, for example, they probably have a lot of high pages per session. 07:43 Because they do a great job of allowing customers to find various different products to compare and contrast and so people are going to be clicking around all around and they may have data that shows that the more pages per session the higher the checkout conversion rate and so they may build 08:02 specific Pacific. Features to encourage people to actually shop around and look at multiple products before making that decision. Number three, bounce rate. 08:11 This reflects the percentage of users who leave the product after viewing just one page. Conversion metrics. This is a really, really, really big and important one. 08:20 These are metrics that track the percentage of users who complete a desired action or set of actions. An example, purchasing a product or signing up for a newsletter. 08:32 So three examples here, conversion rate calculated as the number of conversions divided by the total number of visitors. Number two, shopping cart abandonment rate. 08:42 This is indicating the percentage of users who leave the product after viewing just one page. Users who add items to their cart, but then do not complete the purchase newsletter, sign up conversion rate, showing the percentage of users who subscribe to a new to a newsletter after visiting a specific 08:56 landing page. So this down here is representative of a funnel. So going back to previous lessons with the raw data that we're tracking, you may have an event called user views product page. 09:08 Okay, we see that in a week a hundred users viewed the product page and in that same week we saw that we got the event user purchases product only six times. 09:20 This is actually not bad. We have a six percent conversion rate. This is really important information and you can then segment this down based on the product. 09:29 So say you have five products. You can look, okay, over time like 20 users were looking at product A and one checked out and 30 users were looking at product B and zero checked out and purchased the product. 09:44 And so you can segment this conversion rate based on the product type or other attributes about the events. Next, we have retention metrics. 09:53 These are metrics that measure the ability to keep users engaged or active over time. Retention is absolutely critical because if you, if all you do is bring a user onto your product and they're there, for a day, and then they leave and never come back, that's a failure. 10:08 You're really not going to be able to grow a sustainable business over time. So there's a lot of features and work put into retaining users and keeping them on the platform. 10:19 So a couple metrics here. Turn rate, this indicates the percentage of users who stopped using the product. So you want churn rate to be very low. 10:29 If your churn rate is 20%, that means that out of 30% of those users are continuing to use the product. 11:03 We want it hopefully to be like 90% or 80% or even higher depending on if it's a paid product, for example. 11:12 A high retention rate is going to make sure that the users you're acquiring are staying at a high rate so that the business is continuing to grow over time. 11:22 Number three, daily active users and monthly active users. So these are really important as well because they track, okay, are people actually coming back on a daily basis to our product? 11:33 If you can imagine, TikTok probably has a very high daily active user rate. Whereas another product like Zillow they are operating in a time period where someone is, is probably acutely looking for a house. 11:50 And so they may have, for a period of time, someone coming back multiple times a day even 10, 20 times a day. 11:57 And then they get a house and then they don't come back to the product for eight years. But a company like Zillow is interested in being top of mind. 12:07 So they may build features and they have that really get the users to come back to the product in that time period where they don't like acutely need the product. 12:17 Zillow did this by, by way of creating estimates. I think, I forgot what they're called, Zess Zillow estimates. But basically, they, they built this feature that tracks the value of your home over time. 12:30 And, of course, if, if you're interested in, in, you know, your home as an investment property and, and a large percentage of your assets, you're gonna be pretty interested in how this is tracking over time. 12:43 So you're gonna come back to that product in a daily night. Not a daily, but more frequent basis. Okay, interpreting and acting on metrics. 12:51 So you want to analyze trends and patterns. You want to look for patterns in the data to identify areas of improvement, uncover potential opportunities and, and find if things are going bad for, for some reason. 13:04 So example one is investigating a sudden drop in user engagement to identify potential user experience issues. I'll visualize that on the next slide. 13:12 Analyzing spikes in user acquisition to understand which marketing campaigns are most effective. You can feed that data back to the marketing team or just enable the marketing team to have that data. 13:23 Evaluating the impact of new features on user retention. So if you launch a new feature, say a new onboarding flow, okay, does that new onboarding flow actually increase the rate at which users are retained? 13:37 Or engaging with the product? So if we look for example, one here, a sudden drop in user engagement. So this is a conversion rate over time. 13:45 As you see, within the period of January to March we're kind of operating and it's a little bit noisy, it's going up and down, but we're operating in this range where our conversion rate is between like 8 and 9% on average. 14:01 But then all of a sudden, we see in March, it completely dips to 3%. 3.5%, a little over 3%. This is very, very bad and this is something that your team is going to want to really quickly identify and correct. 14:19 So you want to look, okay, what did we, what happened around March 5th? Did we launch something new? Did something happen in the press or social media that is negatively impacting our business? 14:32 You know, what, what is happening over time? Where is this happening? In later modules in the interviewing section section one of the interviews that you'll have to do as a PM is likely a root cause analysis. 14:46 So they may have a problem specifically like this where they'll say our conversion rate was eight and a half to nine percent for several weeks and then we noticed it dropped to three percent. 14:56 What went wrong? And as a PM, you're going to have to try to figure out, okay, what did go wrong? 15:04 What are the potential factors? And I'll, give you a framework in those lessons on how to identify that and go step by step to try to identify it. 15:12 But this is the type of problem that you will have as a PM and you'll be responsible for driving forward figuring out what happened and then acting on it. 15:20 The next set goals and track progress. So a big part of the PM's job is quarterly. On a quarterly basis to establish targets for key metrics and monitor your progress towards those goals. 15:32 So examples here setting a target conversion rate for a new marketing campaign and measuring its performance against that goal to establish a desired retention rate for a user segment and implement strategies to improve user experience. 15:47 The, the user experience and meet that target. So you might say, okay, for our lawn care businesses, right now our retention rate is 40%. 15:55 We want that to be 80% by the end of Q1. And okay, cool. We have a clear target and goal. 16:04 We, we know what we want to get to. Now we're going to build features and functionality to get us there. So you're going to start to look into, okay, what are the pain points that lawn care businesses have specifically that we are not building solutions for right now that we could. 16:18 And you're going to look at all those ideas, you're going to prioritize them based on different frameworks. And then you're going to implement them and see how they do. 16:26 And then hopefully by the end of the Q1, you'll get that retention score up. And getting that retention rate up is going to impact the business in a positive way. 16:34 So this is the type of thing that you'll be doing as a PM. Another example aiming to reduce churn rate by a certain percentage by enhancing customer support and addressing customer pain points. 16:45 So this is an example. Of how big a checkout conversion increase can be for the business. So say you have a 5% average checkout conversion rate. 16:56 If you set a goal to increase it to 6%, that may not seem like a lot because it's just 1%. 17:02 But that may actually earn you another $100,000 in revenue per year. And if you can continue to increase this or if you can get more users to come in at the top of the funnel, that difference is exponential over time. 17:19 That's going to significantly help the company to grow its revenue and continue to operate and gain profitability. Next. Iterate and optimize. 17:29 You want to use the insights gained from metrics and analytics to make data-driven decisions and improve your product. So a big example and one of the most popular and common things to do is A.B. 17:40 Test different, different things. In this example, different pricing models to determine which one leads to higher conversion rates and revenue. 17:47 You might want to refine the onboarding process to increase user activation rates based on feedback and data analysis that you did. 17:56 Or iterate on the user interface and user experience to improve engagement and satisfaction. So I kind of went over that in the design section of this program. 18:07 These are the types of things that you'll want to use data and leverage data in your decision making process. So an A-B test is when you have basically two versions of a feature. 18:19 And they could be slightly different, completely different and you're going to look at the conversion rate difference. So you may see in this version A, we have 23% of users who completed the conversion. 18:33 They were converted. They completed the funnel. And in this version you have a 37% conversion rate. This version B is way, way, way better than version A. 18:43 And you're going to want to roll a version B out to 100% of users. And the way that you would do this is you would say, okay, for three weeks we are going to have 50% of users see this red version. 18:57 And we're going to have 50% of users see this green version. And then you're going to be looking at that conversion funnel to see, okay, what ended up happening? 19:06 How many people landed on the, the page and saw a and then convert it with a and how many people landed on B and converted with B and then you'll decide, okay it makes sense to roll out B so in conclusion, metrics and analytics are critical for PMs to make informed decisions and really 19:27 drive project. By choosing the right metrics, focusing on acquisition, engagement, conversion, retention, and iterating based on all this info, you can really positively optimize and impact your product in the market. 19:43 So hopefully this helped give you a more deeper understanding of data analytics and how you can use it to make informed decisions for your product area.","Learn how to choose, interpret, and act on acquisition, engagement, conversion, and retention metrics so you can make data-driven product decisions and improvements.",c4dc26db-5bf1-4db0-a517-f2a498160e89,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Metrics and analytics for product managers,7.2,TRUE,20,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:45.379875+00

So, A.B. testing is also known as split testing, split testing, and it's a method for comparing two versions of some type of product, whether it's a website or an app, to determine which performs better. 00:16 By showing these two different versions at the same time you can measure the behavior of the users and PMs can then make decisions based on the data. 00:27 So, we're going to cover the basics of A.B. testing, why it's important, and the steps really to conduct a successful A.B. 00:34 test. This is going to be pretty important in your role likely as a PM because you'll want to be trying to do make the best decisions for your product over time and A.B. 00:43 testing is a tool that basically every single product company uses. So, the importance of A.B. testing. It's essential for optimizing product performance and user experience. 00:55 It helps PMs to make these decisions based on what the users are actually doing in the product. Again, like we want to get away from guessing and use data to make the decisions on what to do. 01:07 Which is almost like it's nice because we don't have to, you know, none of us are Steve Jobs. We don't just inherently know what is better with, you know, our user base. 01:18 And so using this data is a great tool to be able to make those decisions. 01:23 So a couple examples of A.B. tests that could be run. Testing different color schemes to see which one results in higher click-through rates. 01:30 So say you have a checkout button or a subscribe button at the end of your funnel. And right now it is, it has a white background. 01:37 And you want to test a green background. Shockingly, some something like this can actually increase the conversion rate of your product. 01:46 Um, something as simple as updating the color. Now, I wouldn't, you know, as a PM just recommend, hey, let's test changing the color of everything. 01:54 Um, but do so, you know, when you have a hypothesis that it may be better for some reason. Maybe you saw, um, it worked for another company or there's, uh, it will fit better, um, into your product. 02:09 Try, you know, think through what are, what is the hypothesis that I have, um, why do I have that? And then try to figure out, uh, uh, you know, the effort involved in testing it. 02:21 Um, number two, comparing two different onboarding flows to, flows to determine which one leads to better user activation. So the first session and first couple of sessions that a user has in a product are insanely important. 02:34 Um, and so there are teams dedicated to the onboarding experience of these products and over time they're trying to make tweaks here and there or big changes, big bets, um, to, to make it so that more users activate and actually use the product. 02:50 Whether that's subscribing, making an account, whatever it might be, whatever the goal is of your onboarding flow, they are working to over time get it better and better. 02:59 So they're using AV tests to, to improve that. Number three, evaluating the effectiveness of two different marketing messages to identify the one that resonates better with the target audience. 03:09 So you may have a landing page for your product and the big headline, you could test two different headlines against each other and say, okay, this headline for whatever reason is resonating better with the, the users. 03:21 They're clicking through to view the product page at a higher rate and they're converting at a higher rate. Um, you wouldn't want to just guess what is the better headline because who knows? 03:31 You don't know. No one knows until you actually test it with your audience. So what are the steps to conduct a successful A-B test? 03:39 You want to define a clear hypothesis. So before starting the test you want to have this hypothesis in mind. The hypothesis should be based on data feedback or industry best practices. 03:52 Like you should have something to back up while you're coming with this hypothesis. So the hypothesis may be that if we add a progress bar to the onboarding process it'll increase user activation rates. 04:06 And we may have that hypothesis because we've seen that showing users how far they are through an onboarding process makes it feel like they're actually getting towards something instead of completing a never ending flow. 04:22 And so we want to test that within our own product. Um, example two, it could be that a more prominent CTA button will lead to higher conversion rates. 04:30 We may see that in user interviews that we're we're looking at users going on the screen and a lot of them are miss literally missing the main button that we want them to click. 04:41 And so um, making it more prominent, moving it up, um, changing the color, uh, changing what's around it, adding white space, whatever it might be, we might want to test updating that CTA, that call to action button to lead to higher conversion rates. 04:57 And then finally, the hypothesis may be shorter email subject lines might result in higher open rates. And I think this is actually a comment that companies see. 05:09 So, you may have um, a conversion rate, er, sorry, a subject line that says appointment cancelled on September 5th at 3.15 p.m. 05:20 But, um, you might want to test, uh, and say there's something critical in that, uh, email that you want users to do. 05:27 Like, click a button to reschedule. Um, and you may see that 20% of, of users are opening that email. Um, or you could test a subject line that says important appointment update. 05:39 And you may see that 60% of users are clicking into that email. And then actually rescheduling. And so, um, different things like this are, are ways that you will be able to improve the product experience and performance by testing two different versions against one another at the same time. 05:56 Okay, select and split the test audiences. So you'll divide the users into two groups. One for the control and one for the variation. 06:05 The split should be random and the group should be large enough to ensure statistical significance. So statistical significance is basically saying, okay, we have enough of a, we have a large enough dataset to make a strong conclusion from this. 06:19 Um, if you can imagine like a drug trial. If the drug trial is done on 20 people and there are, um, three people who have negative side effects, um, that's not a great sample size. 06:34 Uh, that's a very, very small sample size to make a conclusion from versus imagine a drug trial with 50,000 participants. 06:43 And we see 500 people have, uh, negative side effects from it. And so, you know, obviously the, the, the version with 50,000, uh, participants is going to have more statistical significance. 06:55 We'll be more confident because we've had a much larger sample size. And so if you're a very small startup, sample size is going to be very tricky for, for you because, uh, potentially not a lot of people are actually using your product yet. 07:11 And in those cases, you may have to rely on more gut instinct, user testing, and, and talking to users directly, as opposed to running these experiments. 07:21 Um, but if you're at a larger, company, which is most often the case, um, you'll just want to make sure that the area in which you're running the experiment has enough users using it, coming to it, um, that you'll reach statistical significance. 07:34 And there's tools out there, um, like statistical significance calculator. If you type that into Google, that'll help you determine what, uh, what are the numbers of users that are using it. That we need to actually, um, get to statistical significance for this test. 07:49 Um, so in example one, splitting 50% of users into group A and 50% into group B. Um, two, assigning new users to group A or group B based on a random identifier. 07:59 The engineers on your team will most likely be the ones that are responsible for it. For figuring this out, um, what you're responsible for is making sure that the, the users are being split into these two groups, you're, you're helping them test that, uh, and tracking that data over time. 08:16 Um, yeah, leave the implementation up to the engineers on your team. Okay, then you're going to implement and monitor this test, so you'll create the two variations with your team. 08:25 You'll implement them in the product and then you'll launch it and monitor the test during its duration, ensuring there are no issues or external factors affecting the results. 08:35 So, um, you'll run it for a predetermined time until you're able to reach StatSig. You'll use analytics tools to track the user behavior and monitor the performance. 08:45 And you'll ensure that there are no technical issues like slow loading times or broken links that could, um, you know, accidentally impact the test results. 08:55 Okay, now that you've run the test, you're going to analyze the results and draw conclusions from it. So you will determine the winner and the analytics tool that you may be using might do this automatically or you have to look at it, but you'll evaluate the results based on the original hypothesis and 09:10 goal and decide whether to implement the winning variation or conduct further tests. So if variation B, that progress bar led to a significant increase in user activation rates, you would consider implementing a implementing it across the entire user base. 09:26 You'd most likely roll this out to a hundred percent of users. Um, example two, if there is no statistical significant difference between two variations, you may want to reevaluate the hypothesis. 09:37 You may want to run a new test with different variables. I mean, you might want to tweak one thing here or there or abandon it all together. 09:44 Um, but you're going to look into that. And then if the results are inconclusive, you might, um, again, consider conducting additional tests to, um, or analyze the data to identify like what could have been impacting our, our variation, um, that, that could have negatively impacted it. 10:04 What are some key considerations? I touched on significant statistical significance, but the, to, to reiterate this, it's to ensure that the results are actually valid and reliable. 10:15 Um, that it means that the difference between the control and variation groups is not due to chance. It's not random. 10:22 Um, it's not just like noise it's, it's real. Like, um, when you're looking at A versus B, uh, it, it, the difference between something that is statistical, uh, statistically significant and not, uh, means that you can be confident. 10:36 Um, like 95 or 99% confident that B is better than A if it has statistical significance. If not, you may, it might be, um, you know, only 80% confident or 50% confident. 10:48 A, a toss of a coin, um, could, uh, at any given point, um, uh, make B perform better. And so you want your, um, variations that you're testing to actually be statistically significant. 11:01 So, um, there is this A-B test. A testing guide, um, that, that looks like this that I, I typically use, and this can help determine the sample sizes that are needed and it helps to kind of, um, evaluate the actual results of your, your test. 11:19 Um, so as we see here, um, in this test data, we had 80,000, um, visitors for version A and 1,600 converted and 80,000 visitors for B and 6, 1,696 converted. 11:33 So we see that is a 6% relative uplift in conversion rate and we see that it's a significant test results. 11:41 Um, so, uh, you can be 95% confident that this result is a consequence of the changes you made and not a result of random choice. 11:50 Um, so definitely check out this tool when you're looking into, um, running a test and, and again, you can, um, try to do this pretest and then do it to evaluate the test after it's been run. 12:00 Uh, but this tool is going to really help you, um, to, to make that determination. And there's other, also other things within the world of data that your data team will help you with like monitoring the p-value during the test. 12:12 Um, and, and, uh, yeah, but the goal is really to determine, uh, and draw valid conclusions from, from your test. 12:20 Um, another factor here is external factors. So it's important to consider. Um, any external factors that may impact the results of the test. 12:30 So different things like seasonality, which is like, okay, in, you know, over the holiday period in December, uh, you know, many fewer users may be using your product and that could impact the results of your A-B test. 12:45 Um, marketing campaigns, uh, you may, you know, your marketing team may be running a campaign that drives a ton more, um, unqualified traffic to your experiment and it may throw things off. 12:57 Um, so a couple examples here, uh, in, in, in addition to the ones I've already said, accounting for the effects of holidays, sales events like Black Friday or other time sensitive factors on user behavior. 13:09 Example two, communicating with other teams to ensure that their marketing campaigns or product changes do not coincide with the AB test. 13:16 So if you're at a huge company, it's very possible that there is multiple AB tests running at a given time and you want to make sure that one AB test isn't impacting the results of your AB test. 13:25 Um, and vice versa. Isolating the test environments as much as possible to minimize the impact of, uh, external factors. Um, lastly, iterative testing and continuous improvement. 13:37 So AB testing should be seen as this process that goes on over time. It's not like you do one AB test and then that's it forever. 13:44 You're going to be continuing to run. You want to refine your hypotheses over time and you're always going to want to be wanting to incrementally improve the product experience. 13:55 So a couple examples. After implementing a winning variation, continue to test new ideas and hypotheses to further optimize the experience. 14:03 So, for example, if you're testing version A against the product, you're going to want to test the product. You see version B is way better. 14:09 You roll that out to 100% of users. Now, um, B becomes A and you might want to test another B against that new version. 14:18 And you'll want to continue to do this over and over to get it better and better and better. Sample two, regularly reviewing and updating the roadmap to include new ideas. 14:26 AB tests based on user feedback and data. So say you revamped the entire onboarding experience, but then you're hearing from the customer support team that, uh, there's a specific pain point that is not being solved right now. 14:38 So you'll want to add a new, uh, item to your roadmap to consider testing a solution to solving that pain. 14:46 Okay. So in conclusion, by understanding the basics of AB testing, you can now under, you can now make more informed decisions to improve the product experience. 14:57 So follow these best practices, incorporate this data-driven approach to decision-making, and you are going to be able to really increase the likely We'll be right back. 15:06 Thank you. hood of your product area being successful and ultimately solving problems for your users. Your users are going to be happier, um, when you are giving them the, the right solutions and how do you know they're the right solutions? 15:19 It's by AB testing it and actually looking at the data. All right. I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to plan, run, and analyze A/B tests with hypotheses, audience splits, and statistical significance so you can make data-driven product decisions.",3994f7bf-293f-4e60-8db7-9cd0fe464276,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,A/B testing and experimentation,7.3,TRUE,16,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:45.835058+00
b62c9725cfe141eb896af2af850740aa,"0:00 So in this lesson we're going to go over analyzing and interpreting data. So being able to analyze and interpret data is one of the most important skills that you can have as a PM. 0:12 By understanding the insights gained from it, you can make more informed decisions about what you should do with your products, what, you know, on a daily basis. 0:20 Daily basis, weekly basis, you're making dozens of decisions. And all of them should be optimizing your product and its growth. 0:29 So in this lesson we'll explore different ways and techniques to analyze and interpret the data and some best practices to keep in mind. 0:37 So descriptive statistics, this provides a summary of the data. It allows PMs to understand the general trends and patterns within the dataset. 0:45 So, some examples here, calculating the mean, median, and mode of user session durations to understand the typical length of user interactions. 0:55 If you, you know, get to know these types of different ways to look at the data, understand that maybe the mean or the average is, is really high. 1:06 For example, you, you may look at the, the average income of someone in the United, United States, and the mega-billionaires are going to really offset the, the averages. 1:19 And this is gonna make it, give it a try. A skewed view of, of what the average American is actually making. 1:24 And so you may want to look at a median where it's literally looking at the dead center. If you just stacked everyone in a line and you had all your billionaires all the way on the right. 1:36 But this will give a more accurate middle point of the actual American. Population example to assessing the range variance and standard deviation to understand the dispersion of data points within a given data set creating visualizations like histograms or box plots to display the 1:55 distribution of data. So these are things that you're, you'll likely rely on a data analyst or a data team for but it's always good to at least know about these, these different ways to break down the data and that they exist, so you can ask the right questions of your data, data team. 2:14 Correlation analysis, it helps identify relationships between variables and can help us as PMs understand what factors might be driving different outcomes. 2:24 So, say you have a retention metric, you want to understand, like, what is actually driving that retention metric? Like, what are the levers that we can pull up and down to try to increase that over time? 2:36 So analyzing the correlation between user engagement and conversion rates to identify areas to options. Optimize investigate the relationship between page load time and user bounce rate this is a big one. 2:47 So you might see that a specific page might have a load time of three seconds. That is pretty slow. And you may see that the bounce rate of that page is really high. 3:00 And so you're going to want to potentially consider working with your engineers to decrease that page load time. Like, can we get it down to one and a half seconds? 3:08 Every second counts in, in the world of technology. And, and in the modern day and age, people expect really snappy, fast products. 3:18 So that's, that's you know, you might want to look into the correlation. There or the correlation between user demographics and product usage to inform marketing and targeting strategies. 3:28 So if you see that, you know, if you're segmenting based on region and you see a specific region, just for whatever reason is performing better you might want to inform the marketing team of that so that they can target. 3:41 Better in that area regression analysis, it's a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable, for example, like product revenue and an independent variable, like how much money you're spending on marketing or user engagement. 3:57 So you can use linear regression to model the impact of marketing spend. On the product revenue, you can employ logistic regression to predict the churn rate of users based on different behavior patterns. 4:10 So if users are not doing a certain action and they have an increased user churn rate you might want to drive users to perform that action so you can decrease the churn rate. 4:21 And then using multiple regressions to understand the combined effects of a variety of different factors on one big KPI like the retention rate of your users. 4:32 What are best practices? So you want to ensure data quality and accuracy. This is actually a pretty big problem in the world of tech. 4:42 Is making sure that the data that is actually being collected is accurate and complete. Like if your data is only covering 40% of your user base and then you're making decisions based on it, that's setting yourself up for failure. 4:57 Because that other 60% may really influence the decisions that you're making. So a couple examples here, validating the data sources and cleaning the data to remove outliers or inconsistencies. 5:13 So a good example here is if you have an internal team, say your engineering team is 200 people and those 200 people are constantly using the web. 5:23 That's going to probably skew your, your data. And so you want to try to filter that out in some way. 5:30 You want to make sure you're not including internal employees. Or you see that someone from some country has hacked or try is trying to hack into your website. 5:40 They're making thousands of requests. You're going to want to filter that out so that it doesn't actually impact the decisions that you're making. 5:48 You want to regularly update and maintain datasets to ensure they remain current and relevant. And you'll want to use the right techniques and assumptions to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions from the data. 6:00 You also want to make sure that you're communicating insights effectively and really clearly and concisely. Couple examples here. Creating visualizations from and dashboards to communicate this data to team members and stakeholders. 6:15 Charts are way, way, way easier than trying to comprehend like raw numbers for stakeholders, executives, et cetera. You want to summarize the key findings in a clear and concise manner. 6:27 You want to try to avoid technical jargon when possible unless you're asked. So keep it high level. Ask yourself if I knew nothing about this, like say if this was the first day seen this metric, would I understand it? 6:39 Ask yourself those questions before you're actually delivering it to your boss, your, your stakeholders, et cetera. And also align the data insights with the broader business context. 6:49 So highlight how they implicate the strategy and your decision making. So because we saw that this metric has increased over time, we are concluding that XYZ. 7:01 Also continuous learning and improvement. So data analysis and interpretation should be ongoing. You should be constantly doing this, constantly looking and considering the data, constantly thinking about what additional data could we get to make better decisions. 7:15 So on a quarterly basis, you want to review and update your metrics and KPIs to ensure they remain relevant. Maybe if you've been working for several quarters on increasing a certain metric and you can't seem to move it, maybe it's outside of your control, you might want to review and update 7:31 that what you're tracking. You want to incorporate feedback from stakeholders and users to inform future data analysis efforts. So your manager, one of the executives, may be really interested in finding out how it's been done. And also stay up to date with the latest tools and techniques that 7:52 can be used. You know, there's tons of tools that are, that are going out there. I mean, even chatgbt, I believe you can upload a CSV of raw data and it can start to make and identify trends from it which is really cool and powerful. 8:07 So in conclusion, analyzing and interpreting the data is a really vital skill for PMs. It enables them to make these decisions to improve their product and overall like drive business growth. 8:20 Ultimately, a PM's job is making sure that their area is positively impacting the broader business. So by mastering these techniques and following these best practices, you can unlock insights and deliver outcomes for the products that you're managing and their users. 8:38 Alright, hopefully that helped to understand how to analyze and interpret this data.","Learn how to apply descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression with data-quality best practices so you can make informed product decisions that improve key metrics.",d9b70134-3741-49c5-8ce7-b18c5f39b2b9,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Analyzing and interpreting data,7.4,TRUE,9,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:46.401094+00
cd7d12c502d14e05a4d7121a5c15018c,"00:00 Hello and welcome to Module 8. This module is going to be going over product launch and go-to-market strategy. Okay, so the first lesson here at 8.1 is on defining the go-to-market strategy. 00:13 So a go-to-market sometimes referred to as GTM strategy is the plan for launching Thank you very much. A new product or feature within an existing product outlining how it's going to be positioned in the market, how it will reach and actually engage with the target customers that you are trying to reach 00:31 with your, with your product. So in this lesson, I'm going to go over the essential components of a strategy and for each one provide like two or three examples on basically how you can create a successful go-to-market strategy and plan. 00:47 Okay. So the first thing here is market segmentation and targeting. So before you launch a product, it's really important that you actually identify what is the segment of the overall market that you are trying to reach with your product. 01:03 Who are the customer groups and within those segments, kind of what will the product be doing for those segments. So a couple examples here of market segmentation and targeting. 01:13 Example one is a fitness app and it's going to be targeting health conscious individuals in the age group of 18. 01:22 To 35 years of age. Another example here is a project management tool that is designed for small and medium sized businesses in the software development industry. 01:33 Note that within each of these so far, we're kind of drilling down into a specific market. So we're not saying a fitness app targeted for everyone or a project management tool that anyone can use. 01:46 We're being specific with this because if we're not specific, then we're really going to like miss the mark on a lot of these things. 01:54 It's basically impossible to, or not impossible, but very, very difficult to market somewhat something to literally everyone. Like even the iPhone, for example you know, it's, it's marketed to like everyone hypothetically, but you know that there's a huge segment of the entire global population 02:14 that is on Android and that just won't even consider iOS. So you want to get specific with your target. The third example here is a premium meal kit delivery service, and they are targeting a busy professional, looking for convenient and healthy meal options. 02:31 So this might not apply for everyone. But that's who this brand is targeting. So you want to define who you are actually targeting, what segment of the entire world is targeting. The next is product positioning and value proposition. 02:48 So you want to define what is the unique value prop. Sometimes it's abbreviated as UVP of the product and how it will be positioned in the market relative to all the other competitors out there. 03:01 Because basically, there are competitors for, at this point in the world, basically everything. So you want to figure out what is your unique value proposition for your product. 03:12 How is, how is your product going to be better than other products because of something unique within it. So a couple examples here. 03:19 So it could be a project management tool that differentiates itself because it integrates seamlessly with other popular software tools and maybe all the other project management tools out there don't easily integrate with a bunch of other software tools or they don't integrate at all. 03:36 Another example here is a luxury skin brand emphasizing natural high quality ingredients and sustainable packaging. This is definitely much more popular and common nowadays as people are becoming much more aware of what are what is in the products that they're actually using. 03:53 So a luxury skin care brand may might want to use this as the basis of how they're positioning themselves in the market. 04:02 And then the third example here may be an e-commerce platform that offers a curated selection of products from local artisans positioning itself as a supporter of small business as opposed to an e-commerce platform that may be drop shipping stuff directly from China, for example. 04:19 So that's how they are positioning themselves in the broader world. Next, marketing and sales channels. This is really, really important. 04:32 So you want to identify the most effective marketing and sales channels to reach that target audience that you've defined in previous aspects of this channel. 04:42 So, a couple examples here. One, using social media advertising to target potential customers based on their interests and online behaviors. 04:52 This is a very common one, but you may go on to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and target people who are interested in cooking, for example. 05:02 It may have researched recipes in the last couple of weeks. Number two, establishing partnerships with influencers and bloggers in the industry to promote the product through sponsored content. 05:14 This is like, related to social media, but it's slightly different. And for your target market, maybe your target market really loves to be ingrained in that kind of influencer and blogger scene. 05:29 And by going that route, you're going to have much more luck than going strictly social media advertising. Or three, you could implement a referral program to incentivize the existing customers that you have to recommend the product to their network. 05:42 There's a ton of different marketing and sales channels depending on your product, depending on your customer base, that you can consider. 05:50 And it's, it's important to identify which one do you believe is going to be the most effective. Okay, pricing and revenue model. 05:58 You'll want to determine how your product is actually priced, how you're going to earn revenue for the product. You want to take into account customer expectations, competitors pricing, and overall, what is the business trying to achieve? 06:12 You know, are we trying to break even with a specific product and make most of our money on the back end on other services? 06:19 Are we trying to be profitable with the product that you are launching now? So these are some of the things you want to consider, and we'll go into pricing a little bit later in the course as well, but this is something that you'll want to consider as part of the product launch and go-to-market 06:33 strategy. So a couple examples here. You could have a subscription-based pricing model for a SaaS product with tiered plans offering different levels of product. 06:43 This is really, really, really, really popular and this is one of the most common things that you'll see in, you know, these tools online that are available for people, consumers, but also businesses as well. 06:57 You could have a freemium model for a mobile app, and users could access basic features for free, but then they must access it for free. Pay for premium features and content to get that next level. 07:06 So you might have 90% of your user base with, you know, on the free plan, but then that 10% of the user base, they are interested in upgrading for the premium content, and they're willing to pay, and that 10% is who is kind of really driving your business forward, but, you, you really need that 07:25 , that, that free level to get people ingrained and get people onto the app before you can then upsell them and get them in that premium tier. 07:33 Number three, a value-based pricing strategy for a premium service where the price is set based on the perceived value it provides for its customers. 07:41 So this is going to be more unique depending on the model that strategy. You want to include key markets. Milestones and deadlines for each stage of the process. 08:06 And you'll just want to map this out and clearly communicate it to your internal stakeholders. So a couple examples here, you could set a product launch date with milestones for completing market research, product development, and all the marketing activities involved, like creating the ads, uploading 08:23 the ads, investing the ads, you know, ramping up the ads. Example two, establishing deadlines for coordinating product launch events, webinars, or promotional campaigns. 08:33 So say a large part of your strategy is going to be doing this online event where your CEO is doing a live stream to announce the product. 08:43 You want to make sure that you as a product manager are driving that forward by establishing deadlines for it. Number three, you want to define post launch milestones for assessing product performance, customer feedback, and making necessary adjustments. 08:56 So that's, you know, just because you launched a product doesn't mean it's over. There's things that you have to do afterwards to make sure it was actually successful. 09:05 So in conclusion, defining a go-to-market strategy is really important to making sure that you're successfully launching a product. Launching a product literally may be like a brand new product or it could be just a new feature within an existing product that has been around for 10 years. 09:24 You still want to always think about what is our go-to-market strategy. How are we bringing this new product to the market? 09:33 So within that, you want to consider market segmentation, define the market, product positioning, how are you being unique, what is your value proposition that is different than all the competitors. 09:44 Marketing and sales channels, what is the best way to reach the target market that you identified in that first step? 09:50 Pricing, how are you going to price this? Is this included in one of the plans you already have? Are you going to charge extra for it? 09:56 How are you know, you know, have you done any research to see if that's the best pricing? Timeline, have you defined what are the milestones to actually reach the target market? How do you actually launch this thing? 10:06 Doing all of this as part of your product development process is really going to level you up, level your product up and make sure you're driving actual product adoption and business growth once you launch. 10:19 Alright, I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to define a go-to-market strategy by specifying target segments, positioning, channels, pricing, and timelines so you can launch products effectively and drive adoption.",59ee6c33-fa0a-4c1b-bece-3a2e29296e90,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Defining the go-to-market strategy,8.1,TRUE,11,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:46.874677+00
af6b41328e6949d6830afb056c94a234,"00:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over coordinating product launches, okay? So coordinating a product launch, it involves orchestrating a bunch of different activities basically across different teams, whether it is the product team, an engineering team, whether it's the marketing and sales team, etc. 00:18 You want to make sure that everyone is aligned and meeting these deadlines so that you can effectively drive forward the launch process. 00:26 So in this lesson, I'm going to go over different elements of coordinating a product launch and provide some examples along each step to make sure that you have the skill set and knowledge to manage a successful launch. 00:38 Okay, so cross-functional collaboration. A successful launch requires you to collaborate successfully and all the members of each teams to collaborate successfully between each other. 00:50 So that's like product team, whether it's the product managers, product designers, you may have multiple product teams working on a launch. 00:57 Engineering, making sure that the engineers are coordinated. Marketing with one another, they have the right technical functionality documented and distributed to other teams so that other teams know what's going on. 01:10 Marketing, marketing needs to know what you're planning on launching when you're planning on launching it. Sales, sales team knows the feature, they're able to talk to end customers about the feature, they have answered their questions answered by you, customer support. 01:26 When a customer inevitably reaches out to the customer support team based on a question about the new feature you're launching, your customer support team needs to have the materials to actually respond effectively. 01:41 And answer those questions for the customers and more. So establishing clear communication channels and fostering a really collaborative environment is crucial for a CMOS launch. 01:51 What I like to do is in most tech companies out there, you have Slack and within Slack, you can create a project channel. 01:59 So you might name it like PROJ. So this is the project onboarding launch channel. And within that channel, you have all these different stakeholders in there. 02:12 You are sending out updates in there. If there's a question that comes up, you're tagging the right stakeholders to answer those questions. 02:20 You have links to the go-to-market doc, the product requirements doc, and everything is coordinated in this one channel. And you know, this is going to create a great, effective environment for you to ensure that the product launch that you are working on is going to go off without a hitch. 02:40 Alright, so I'll go. Oh, into a couple different examples here in terms of cross-functional collaboration. Example one, you might want to hold a regular cross-functional meeting to discuss progress, address concerns, and keep everyone informed about the launch timeline. 02:55 So if you're launching a product and it's on the three to six month timeframe, you might want to do a monthly Bye. 03:01 Meeting with all the cross-functional stakeholders or every two weeks, for example. But if it's something that's going to take one month to launch, you might want to do a weekly meeting to keep everyone informed because it's going to move a little bit quicker. 03:14 Example two, you might use a project management tool to assign tasks, track progress, and keep all the stakeholders updated on the status. 03:21 Launch related activities. So this could be JIRA, this could be another project management tool, but this can be a way for you to document. 03:29 So if anyone has a question around what are the tasks left to do, where are we in this overall you know, process, they can go to one link and learn about it. 03:40 It could even be Google Sheets for example. Example three, create a central repository for launch related documents. So Coda is a big one for this, or Google Drive, or Notion for example, you, you want someone to be able to go to one place where there's all the documents and assets and 03:58 links in one place so that whoever is interested in learning about it they have just one place to go to and they can find the information. 04:05 It's really difficult and frustrating for internal stakeholders to have to try to search all around your, your workspace, whatever your company has for the relevant docs, they'll end up messaging you directly and you want to avoid that. 04:20 You want to just have everything in one place. Okay, so pre-launch preparations. So before launching the product, it's important that all the materials are in the right place and you ensure the teams are ready to execute. 04:34 So a couple examples here, develop marketing assets such as website content, promotional materials, social media campaigns, well in advance of the launch. 04:44 So you know, you may need to update the landing page of your website and one of the things you're gonna have to work on is what is the content that we're displaying on the landing page? 04:53 What is the text? What are the visuals that we're going to include? Should those visuals be consistent with the ads that we are going to test on social media? 05:03 We want a cohesive marketing experience from beginning to end. Number two is something that you can do. You can train the sales and customer support teams on the new product features and benefits so they can effectively communicate to the customers. 05:18 You could do this in the form of a loom video recording. So you can video record you going through the feature doing a demo and answering different questions that you anticipate those teams will have. 05:29 Or you could do a 30-minute or a one-hour session with the sales leaders and customer support team leaders where you're similarly doing a demo but it's live and you're answering questions and encouraging them to ask questions that they may think customers will have. 05:45 The customer support and sales teams are actually really, really, really good at identifying, you know, what a customer might be thinking about because they are the ones that are literally talking to customers on a day-to-day basis. 05:58 Number three is that you could do user testing and address any issues She's been. Before the launch. This will allow you to minimize those post launch adjustments and customer complaints that will inevitably come up. 06:10 Okay, launch execution. So executing a successful product launch involves really closely monitoring the rollout. The rollout being the, you know, turning on the feature, ramping it up. 06:22 If maybe it starts at 5% of the user base, then we go up to 25% and then 100%, etc. You want to monitor that rollout really closely. 06:32 You want to address issues promptly. So for example, maybe a bug comes up or there's an outage and you have to roll back the feature. 06:40 You're going to work with your tech team to make sure that you're, you're thinking about this properly and you want to coordinate this across multiple teams. 06:47 You are the person that is driving this across all those teams and all those stakeholders. Okay, so a couple examples here. 06:55 I went over that phased or soft launch process. So that's where you gradually roll out the products to a limited audience to identify and resolve of any issues before a full scale launch. 07:05 So this is really, really popular. If you could imagine like Google Maps, for example, it would be pretty dangerous of them to launch a brand new version of the app to immediately every user. 07:19 They're going to start with probably 1% of the user base. And they're going to see how it's affecting that user base. 07:27 And say, for example, it's negatively affecting them. Well, okay, that's not great that it's negatively affecting that 1%. But we have prevented 99%, which is tens of millions of users from experiencing this bad user experience. 07:43 Eames often times phase stuff out, especially these large features, and gradually roll it out over time while they're monitoring issues. 07:53 Example 2, you could monitor the social media pages that you have, or reviews, reddit threads, etc. You want to look at customer support inquiries. 08:02 So when you're soft launching, are people starting to write in? Are they confused? And, and other channels that are popular for your product. 08:10 Maybe you have a community platform as well. And then number 3 is execute marketing campaigns and promotions in a timely manner in alignment with the launch schedule. 08:19 It would be kind of a miss if you launched a product in February and then you started marketing it in June. 08:26 That's going to be a huge disconnect that, that really just hurts the team overall because you're not going to get great data and great traffic coming to your feature to evaluate if it's successful or not. 08:36 So post launch evaluation. So now that you've launched the product, it's really important to take a look at how it's doing. 08:44 You want to evaluate whether or not it's successful. You want to gather feedback and you want to make adjustments to optimize the product and future launches. 08:52 No product launch is ever done per se. You always want to be continually improving upon what you're putting out there for users. 09:00 So a couple different things to do here. One, collect an analyzed data on product adoption, user engagement and customer feedback to measure the success of the launch. 09:10 So maybe you had a hypothesis that 30% of users would engage with that feature. Okay, what ended up happening? Was it 40%? 09:19 Was it 10%? You want to collect and analyze that and then make decisions based on it. So say 10% of users are engaging with it and you and you really needed 30% to engage. 09:31 Well, okay, why is that happening? Are, are users not finding out about it? Are they not finding value from it? 09:38 Is it valuable to continue to spend engineering resources on trying to get from 10% to 30%? What can you try to improve about it, etc. 09:47 You could do a post-mortem analysis to identify areas for improvement and lessons learned for future launches. So this is like an internal team meeting about the project specifically not necessarily a sprint but about a product launch where you could say, okay, everyone for 10 minutes, let's 10:05 brainstorm what went well with this launch, what did not go well, and what can be improved for next time. And then from that, you'll take notes, you'll have discussion, and you'll come out with action items. 10:16 Things that you can do and members on your team or members on the marketing team or whatever can do to make the next launch that you guys have as a team. 10:25 Ultimately, you want your teams to be operating really well with one another, and so a postmortem is a great tool that you can leverage to actually improve and level up your teams. 10:37 Number three, you'll want to update your product roadmap and priorities based on feedback and performance in the market. So, say you had a whole roadmap, out there that was you know, based on your initial hypothesis about how your feature would perform. 10:51 So once you launch it, if it is performing really, really well, you may be able to remove different things on your roadmap that you anticipated you'd have to do but you no longer have to do because the product is already performing well. 11:04 Or, you had a roadmap and the product launch that you had did not go well, and you actually have to iterate on it. 11:11 So you're going to want to update your roadmap to add in time to iterate on that product launch if it makes sense. 11:17 So in conclusion, coordinating a product launch is a complex process. It involves a lot of cross-functional collaboration. Thought preparation and ongoing evaluation, but hopefully within this lesson, I gave you kind of the different phases and examples of things that you can do within each phase to 11:35 be effective at managing this product launch process and ensuring that the product that you do launch is adopted. As well, and ultimately it impacts your business in a positive way. 11:49 All right, I'll see you in the next lesson.",Learn how to coordinate a cross-functional product launch from pre-launch planning through rollout and post-launch evaluation so you can deliver on time and improve adoption.,ccff0c4a-148b-40be-9fe6-07ab82be5d08,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Coordinating product launches,8.2,TRUE,12,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:47.319157+00
4881564d4cd649d1b76625223a71a1e7,"0:00 In this lesson, we're going to go over marketing and sales alignment. Okay, so aligning the marketing and sales teams are really important for a successful product launch, because both of these teams play a really important role in reaching the actual audience that you're trying to target with their 0:17 this feature and converting them into customers. Because the sales and marketing teams, those are the teams that are really communicating the value to users before they are able to actually realize the value by using the product, if that makes sense. 0:33 So we'll discuss the importance of really gaining alignment across these teams and ensure you have the tools that you can really work with to gain this alignment across those teams. 0:46 So number one, you want to establish common goals and objectives. So both the marketing and sales teams should have a shared understanding of what are our goals and objectives for this product launch. 0:58 That alignment on the goals and objectives will mean that their efforts, what they end up actually doing to prepare for the launch and what they execute during the product launch, are aligned and they have the same outcomes. 1:12 It would not make sense if your sales team is trying to do one thing and your marketing team is trying to do another thing and you are trying to do a separate thing, you want all these teams to make sure that the end goal, that goal post from getting from point A to point B, B is the same across 1:30 those teams. So an example here, you might want to create a shared set of KPIs for the launch. This could be like a number of leads generated for the product, it could be a conversion rate, so a checkout conversion rate, it could be sales, revenue targets whatever it might be, you want to make 1:47 sure that you align on the right target and goal amongst the other stakeholders within sales and marketing. The next is communicating the product value prop and messaging. 1:59 So it's really important that the marketing sales teams understand and communicate to the target market that you're trying to go after. 2:06 What is that unique value proposition for your product so that users, potential users, prospective users, they know it upfront and then when they get to the product they can actually realize and see it and use it. 2:21 This creates a coherent kind of experience for your customers from wherever they are on the internet or in the world to actually using your product and getting value out of it. 2:32 So an example here, you could develop a product messaging document or playbook and that will outline the product's unique selling points, key benefits and target audience. 2:41 And that would then be used by the marketing and sales teams. So if you're creating a new feature that helps customers create pricing tiers for their products, you will create a document that outlines what are the different things that we did compared to our competitors that actually separate us. 3:01 And differentiate us in a positive way. That way the marketing and sales teams will be able to easily use that document as a reference point for all the creatives and sales pitches and everything that they end up creating. 3:15 Then you'll want to coordinate marketing and sales activities. So this ensures that both teams are working in tandem to do whatever the goal is. 3:24 Promote the product to get leads, close deals, etc. So you might want to develop a joint launch calendar and that calendar will outline the timing of marketing campaigns, sales outreach, and other activities to ensure that everyone is synchronized and supporting one another. 3:41 As I mentioned, in the previous lesson, if the product launches in February and the sales team starts telling customers about it in June, that's going to be a complete miss. 3:51 So you want to make sure you gain alignment on these different efforts so that they happen in a similar timeframe. 3:59 Next you want to share insights and feedback. Teams the product team, the marketing team, the sales teams, everyone can benefit from sharing insights and feedback because it can help identify opportunities for improvement and better understand the customer needs. 4:13 So a classic example is if the marketing team is running and experimenting with three different types of ads within the three ads. 4:22 They're communicating different value propositions, unique value propositions for your launch and they might see that one of the ads with one of the unique value propositions is performing way way way better than the other two. 4:37 Now this may be unexpected, but it would be really beneficial for the marketing team. To tell you that as a product manager, that this value prop for whatever reason is, is really converting users at a much higher rate. 4:52 And that could inform your strategy. You might want to continue, continue to invest and pour more resources into that unique value prop. 5:00 You might want to message that value prop. Inside the product directly, you might want to get users to perform that action must much faster. 5:09 So there's a lot of different ways that sharing insights between your teams will really level up and get your product to perform better. 5:18 So you'll want to hold regular meetings between these stakeholders. You'll want to. Share challenges. You'll want to exchange info on what a customer is saying. 5:27 What are, what market trends are, are we experiencing? All this information is going to be gathered and be really important as an input into the decisions that you make as a product manager. 5:40 The next is a measure performance and adjust strategy. So this is closely tied to what I was talking in the previous slide, but you want to continually monitor and evaluate the performance of both marketing and sales efforts during the product launch. 5:54 And this can help to identify ways that you can improve and inform how you should change your strategy over time. 6:01 So another example here is track the marketing campaigns, the different ads that are running against the shared KPIs that you came up with in previous steps, and adjust tactics as needed based on how they're actually doing, the data that you're gathering, and the insights that you are learning about 6:19 . So in conclusion, really aligning the marketing and sales teams is super important for a successful product launch. It helps to create a cohesive experience from wherever the customer is in their journey, whether they don't even know about your product yet, where they know about it but they haven't 6:37 converted yet, etc. Creating a cohesive experience from that starting point to the ending point. The ending point being your, your customer finding value, your customer paying you, your customer being retained, whatever you as an organization define as kind of success for your customer and 6:55 it'll allow you to then optimize resources and overall drive better results. So hopefully this helped you understand the different things that you can do to encourage this really positive collaboration amongst the teams and I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to align marketing and sales on goals, messaging, activities, and shared metrics so you can run a coordinated product launch that drives conversions.",f8046d4e-efb2-45df-8aea-890622347910,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Marketing and sales alignment,8.3,TRUE,8,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:47.89986+00
49529b5f6abf44e083dabce4bd411151,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over post launch monitoring and optimization, so once a product is actually launched, it's really important to then monitor how it is doing, how it is performing, and then you can make necessary optimizations, adjustments to maximize its success. 0:16 So in this lesson I'll discuss different strategies for doing this monitoring after launch and optimizing based on it. That includes tracking KPIs, gathering feedback from users, and overall refining the product based on what you're learning. 0:31 So tracking KPIs. As I've gone over in previous modules around data, it's important that you establish KPIs during the planning phase. 0:40 To then understand how the product is actually performing against the goals. So the KPI could be a number of different things. 0:47 It could be engagement, conversions, retention, etc. But you want to actually make sure that you're looking at this data after you launch. 0:56 Just launching a product is an exciting milestone, but it's not the end goal. The end goal is to actually drive impact, change the metrics, change the dynamics of the business. 1:07 Because businesses want to improve over time. They don't want to stay stagnant. So a couple examples here. You could track metrics like user engagement. 1:15 How many people are engaging and using a particular feature. What is the customer satisfaction? You know, do we have an average rating of 9.5 out of 10? 1:27 For customer satisfaction. How has our revenue changed? Has our revenue started to grow at a faster rate month over month? 1:34 Maybe every month you know, we've observed a 10% month over month increase in our revenue. Launch a new product has that increased to 15% or 20%? 1:45 That would be a huge change that you want to celebrate. And, and you'll learn based on that. So you want to track these KPIs after you actually launch a product and then think about, okay, what does this mean? 1:58 What, what is this going to do for our product? Okay, next, you want to collect and analyze user feedback. So once you launch a product, gather feedback in any way possible, whether it's just analyzing customer support tickets, it's an actual feature, it's doing user interviews. 2:14 And this feedback is going to provide valuable insights into what are the strengths and weaknesses of your product. What is, what are the areas of improvement? 2:23 What can you do over time to make your product even better? So as I mentioned, surveys, interviews, in-app feedback, where you could have a little pop up at the bottom that's, that asks the user to in the moment rate, how they're enjoying the, the experience, the new feature, et cetera. 2:38 And then over time, you can analyze this data and then identify your product. By trends and patterns and make decisions based on it. 2:45 Okay. You could also A-B test. We went over this in previous lessons, but you could run A-B tests and experiments that will help optimize different parts of the product. 2:54 So an example of an A-B test that you could run is on the features that are within each plan. You could A-B test different pricing tiers for the product. 3:04 So, you could see what happens if you launch a feature or a product at a particular price. Whether it's $10 a month or $8 a month. 3:15 You may see that more people convert at the $8 a month product tier, pricing tier, and overall that segment of the customer base generates more revenue than the $10 a month version. 3:31 And so you'll want to consider running different experiments like this with the end goal again of optimizing and maximizing the success of your product. 3:41 And again, all this is going to tie back to data. What is the data telling us? What are we learning from the data? 3:49 So another example here to reiterate the point is that after you initially launch, you could test different onboarding flows to determine which one leads to higher user activation rates. 4:00 Use your activation. It typically refers to a converted user. So, how many users sign up and then convert? That could be considered an activated user. 4:12 And then you'll want to go with the winning variation. Next, you'll want to monitor the competitive landscape. So, keep an eye on what the competition does in the months after you launch. 4:22 Can you identify different trends or threats or opportunities that may impact your product's ability to continue to be successful? So, review their products, their pricing pages, their marketing materials, their customer reviews. 4:38 Try to see if they launch similar features to you. Do they do it in a little bit of a different way? 4:44 Ultimately, use this to make adjustments to your product strategy if needed. Next, iterate and refine the product. Based on everything you're learning from the product launch, from the experience, you want to then iterate on it. 4:59 Look at the KPIs, look at the feedback, look at your competitors, and then actually take a look back at your product. 5:07 Refine it, enhance it. Ultimately, you want to meet customer needs and drive growth for your business. So if user feedback indicates that a particular feature that you launched is confusing, work with your dev team and designers to redesign and improve the feedback. 5:25 So in conclusion, post-launch monitoring and optimization is this ongoing process that helps you as a product manager to identify different ways that you can improve your product experience, it can allow you to stay ahead of competition, and it makes sure that the product is continuing to solve customers' 5:46 pain points, it solves their problems, it meets their needs. So by tracking KPIs, collecting different feedback, and then making data-driven decisions about what you're learning, you can optimize the experience and drive long-term success for your product area and the business as well. 6:02 Alright, thank you for watching this one.","Learn how to monitor post-launch performance using KPIs, user feedback, experiments, and competitive insights so you can iteratively optimize the product and drive growth.",bf9c4a5c-b43b-4fff-b44c-6bdcfcf176e1,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Post-launch monitoring and optimization,8.4,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:48.362848+00
969038c60a594edf9ef4a42689487494,"0:01 In this module, we're going to go over launching products from 0 to 1. The first lesson here, 9.1, is the intro to this concept of launching a product from 0 to 1. 0:13 So it is really taking a product from just an idea. An idea in someone's head, an idea on paper, to a functioning product in their mind. So this concept was popularized by Peter Thiel's book, 0 to 1. 0:26 It highlights the importance of creating new value and capturing a significant share of a market. So in this lesson, we're going to explore what is the 0 to 1 concept and discuss different stages involved to bringing a product to life. 0:41 So first off, understanding the 0 to 1 concept. It focuses on creating something new and innovative as opposed to just copying or incrementally improving an existing product or solution. 0:53 So by launching a product from 0 to 1, you're creating brand new value in the market and setting the stage for rapid growth. 1:00 A great example of a recent 0 to 1 is TikTok. TikTok really, like, came into the market and revolutionized the way that we're consuming media by introducing this short form content in this scrollable you know, feed. 1:18 And you've now seen Instagram copy it, YouTube copy it, but TikTok was you know, really the, the one that came in and had massive success with this new concept. 1:30 So another example is instead of building another messaging app with slightly improved features, a company might create a new communication platform that altogether revolutionizes the way teams collaborate and work together. 1:44 Okay. So what are the stages in these zero to one process? There are several stages here, including number one, identifying and validating a new product idea. 1:53 That's very important. The next is building an MVP. You're not trying to build the Mona Lisa from, you know, from the beginning, you want to build an MVP, a minimum viable product. 2:04 Number three is acquiring early stage customers who are going to be the people who are trying your product out right at the beginning and then iterating based on user feedback. 2:13 So what is, you know, let's talk about the importance of innovation. So innovation is really at the core of the zero to one concept because it emphasizes the need to create this brand new value for potential users rather than really just like tweaking, iterating, improving on existing solutions out 2:32 there in the market. So by focusing on this brand new innovation, companies can completely differentiate themselves in the market and then just run. 2:43 Another example of this is Uber. Uber completely revolutionized the way that people, you know, get around without a car and disrupted the taxi industry. 2:57 So another example is the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. It completely transformed the mobile phone market. It led to the creation of the modern smartphone industry which has basically changed the entire world. 3:12 What are some challenges and risks in launching products from zero to one? So it can be a challenge, number one, to launch it and it can also be risky. 3:22 It involves entering uncharted territory because you are innovating completely. You're making something brand new the market has not seen before. 3:31 So you're gonna, in order to do this, you might make significant investments in research, development, and marketing. So PMs need to be prepared for different setbacks and failures. 3:43 As well as the need to really be flexible and pivot and adapt their strategy as they learn more about the market and their customers because again launching something zero to one means that it hasn't necessarily been done before so it's not like you're going to snap your fingers it's going to be successful 3:58 you you may have to tweak things here and there you might have to pivot all together to to create this successful product in a zero to one environment. 4:08 So another example of a challenge is a company that may be attempting to introduce a new electric vehicle or vehicle technology to the market. 4:16 They may face different challenges like limited infrastructure to do so, high production, costs may be very, very expensive to actually do this, or regulatory hurdles. 4:27 The government might get involved and say, hey, we're not allowing you to do this. This is going to be considered illegal if you launch this. 4:33 So in conclusion, launching a product from zero to one is both challenging, but really insanely rewarding. If successful it requires innovation, perseverance, and adaptability. 4:47 By focusing on creating something brand new, the, the solution needs to be new and innovative in the market. You're going to address unmet needs and PMs can set the stage for rapid growth and long, long-term success of the product. 5:02 So, in the further lessons in this module, I'm going to dive into different key stages involved in launching these products and discuss different ways that you can be successful with it. 5:12 Alright, I'll see you in the next one.",Learn how to define the zero-to-one product launch process and its stages so you can plan an innovative product from idea to early customers.,c9f776db-d85c-4ba5-a730-c79ade2ead8c,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Introduction to the 0 to 1 concept,9.1,TRUE,6,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:48.965684+00
e25df3bdff9742588a1d0dfa091683bd,"0:00 Okay, in this lesson, I'm going to go over identifying and validating new product ideas. Okay, so an intro here. Identifying these ideas and validating them is extremely crucial as a part of the 0-1 process. 0:15 It ensures that your product is actually going to address an unmet need in the market, Thank you for watching. Have a great day. 0:20 And have the potential to actually generate value for users and the company. You know, most products fail, and one of the reasons is that in that initial validation phase, people aren't really doing much to validate. 0:35 They may think in their head that something's going to work and they have a gut feeling about it, but then they don't actually go through the steps Thanks. 0:42 Now, I will say when you do validate stuff it still has the potential to fail, unfortunately. And that's why this is a hard industry. 0:51 But this is a really important part in the overall zero to one process. So in this lesson, I'll go into different strategies to identify and validate new products. 1:00 Product ideas along with ways to evaluate their success over time. So the first thing here, identifying new product ideas. So, to identify ideas, PMs can use a variety of different techniques like researching the market that they're investing in, doing customer interviews, doing different 1:18 brainstorm sessions with people on their team. Or, customers, and doing competitive analysis. So, within all of that, the goal is to try to identify opportunities for massive innovation and, and, and solve problems for unmet customer needs that, that they've found. 1:36 So a couple examples here. You could conduct customer interviews to uncover pain points and challenges. That existing products in the market fail to address adequately. 1:45 Like, no one is really solving a particular part of the customer's need. Example two, you could analyze market trends and emerging tech to identify different opportunities for innovation. 1:56 So, artificial intelligence is the best one here. So, artificial intelligence, is something that started becoming really trendy and, and really hyped up over the last year, or slash couple of years. 2:11 And companies might say, okay, like, no, literally, because this is a brand new technology, no one is leveraging yet, it yet, and we can do, we can leverage it in a way that will help our customers solve their problems. 2:23 And, and so we're going to go and do that. And this is a way to innovate, go from zero to one because there's an emerging technology that no one is leveraging yet. 2:32 Number three, you could examine competitors offerings and identify gaps in their lineup that can then be exploited. Okay. Validating new product. 2:41 So you've come up with that idea. How do you validate it? So it involves gathering evidence basically to support the hypothesis that the product idea that you've come up with will be successful in the market. 2:53 So this can be done through a variety of different methods like customer surveys, market tests, building an MVP and then gathering feedback from it. 3:02 But the goal really is to make sure that once you have, once you have idea, you then get evidence out in the world that supports that your product idea will actually end up being successful before you potentially pour tons of engineering and design and marketing resources into it. 3:22 So, for example, you could conduct a survey to gauge the level of interest and potential demand for a new product among a target customer segment, and you're going to want really strong evidence within these survey results to demonstrate that it's going to be successful. 3:36 Example two, you might test the product idea in a small-scale market trial, so you could launch a beta version to a select group of users, and again, you're going to want to see evidence in the data and the feedback of that test that really are strongly pointing to it being potentially successful. 3:54 Number three, you might want to build an actual minimum viable product an MVP meaning it is solving the basic needs of the customer, use it to gather feedback and measured success in addressing the problem and then go from there. 4:10 If it is showing and demonstrating that it is insanely effective at solving the problem, you're probably onto something. But if customers are really confused by it, they drop off, they're not finding much value from it, they're going back to existing solutions it might mean that your idea is not 4:27 innovative enough and executed well enough to, to actually eventually be successful. So then you want to evaluate the potential success of the product idea. 4:38 So you want to do this by considering different things. Like, what is the market size here? Are we talking about a thousand users in the globe who may be interested in this? 4:49 Are we talking about millions? What are the competitors? Are any competitors trying to do this? Are they already launched? Where in the process are they? 4:58 How profitable can we be with this? Like, is this going to be the 30% profit margin and 90% profit margin? 5:06 What, what in terms of the business fundamentals and unit economics are we considering here? And how feasible is it? Are we trying to do something that is really difficult to do? 5:18 Like, for example as a space company. An aerospace company, are we trying to launch a rocket into space? That's going to be very, very challenging. 5:29 Can we even do that? So it helps in prioritizing ideas and focus on the ones that actually have the highest potential for success. 5:37 So a couple additional examples here. You might want to assess the total addressable market, the new product to estimate its revenue and growth opportunities. 5:46 Again, what what segment of the market are we talking about here? Are we talking about schools, high schools, high school nurses? 5:56 Okay, there is a finite number of them. What is that number? How much can we potentially earn in revenue? If we get a hundred percent market saturation? 6:06 Number two, analyze the competitive landscape to understand strengths and weaknesses of existing products. And that way you're going to identify potential differentiators for your product. 6:16 Number three, you might want to evaluate the costs and resources to build, launch, and market the product. To figure out if it might be profitable and actually have a positive return on investment. 6:26 If it's going to take a trillion dollars to develop a rocket like, where is that money coming from? What is the revenue that's going to eventually be generated by it? 6:36 You need to consider these things to understand if it's actually worthwhile to invest in and actually try to accomplish. So in conclusion here, identifying and validating these new product ideas is one of the most important things that you can do in this zero to one phase because it helps ensure that 6:54 the product will actually address an unmet need and have the potential to succeed in the broader market once it's actually launched. 7:03 Combining research testing and evaluation techniques, PMs can identify and validate different ideas that may be promising, but you want to make sure that they actually have the potential for success and prioritize those against one another. 7:19 So in the next lesson, we'll go deeper into actually building an MVP. And using it to gather feedback and refine the product concept. 7:27 Alright, I'll see you in the next one.","Learn how to identify and validate new product ideas using research, testing, and feasibility evaluation so you can prioritize concepts likely to succeed in the market.",098cc380-98e5-429f-b2de-f44e54204393,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Identifying and validating new product ideas,9.2,TRUE,8,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:49.480472+00
9951ee962c834a93859ed8e3fbaebbf2,"0:00 Okay, so in this lesson, we'll go over building an MVP, a minimum viable product. So building an MVP is an important part of the zero to one process because it allows PMs and companies to test their ideas with real users out in the world, get feedback back from them and then make iterative improvements 0:20 . So in this lesson, we'll discuss the concept of an MVP, the benefits of doing it, and then what are the steps to actually build and launch an MVP effectively. 0:31 So what is an MVP? Typically, when you're when you're referring to it in meetings and stuff like that, everyone's going to say MVP, MVP. 0:38 You. As a note, no one typically says like what is the minimum viable product that we can have here people typically say like what is the MVP solution for this. 0:48 I also wanted to note that MVPs are not exclusive to launching things from zero to one. You may be evaluating different things on your roadmap, enhancements on existing features, and you might be talking about a huge change to an existing feature, but someone may say like what is the MVP version of 1:06 updating this. They're just basically saying like what are what is the minimum we can do to actually change this in a tangible way to, you know, improve the experience overall. 1:17 So to go to dive into this and actually define it, an MVP is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early adopters and provide valuable feedback for future development. 1:31 So if you can think of like a Mercedes Benz, it has every possible luxury feature that you can think of. 1:40 In, in the in the car and one of the worst things that you could do would be to try to build a Mercedes from scratch and get it to that quality before actually validating anything with, with early adopters. 1:53 So you want to test your product idea in the market with just enough features where you're solving the core pain point. 2:01 But it doesn't have all the bells and whistles and it doesn't work perfectly because you want to learn from users and then refine the product over time without going down the, you know, rabbit hole of investing tons of resources into making every part of the product great and amazing from your lens, 2:17 but it hasn't actually been validated with real users. So to dive further into the different benefits of building the MVP number one, faster time to market. 2:28 So by focusing on just the core features, you can develop and launch your product faster. You allow it allows you to test it viability in the market and gather user feedback. 2:39 So an example of this is like a grocery. A delivery app. This happened in New York City recently in the last couple of years, but all within a similar timeframe. 2:48 Like many, like three or four different grocery delivery apps popped up really quickly. And the one that got to market the first, they you know, the app was not complete. 3:00 For example, like to update your email address or, or update settings about your account, you had to email their customer support and you couldn't do it in the app at all. 3:11 You might think like this is a crucial aspect of our, of our product. But it ended up not being crucial. 3:18 Like the crucial part of a grocery delivery app is getting groceries delivered. Delivered. And so they solved that first. And then once they solved that, they doubled back later on in future updates, actually add add account settings and add the ability to do that after they validated that 3:35 , okay, people in the New York city market do want their groceries delivered in 20 minutes and we are able to make a profit. 3:41 Doing this, etc. Risk reduction. An MVP helps you validate your product idea without spending, you know, weeks or months of time and with re- with, with engineering resources, with money, with marketing and it allows you to validate this and, and make a really informed decision 4:03 on whether or not you want to actually go ahead and put it into full-scale development and, and really put a lot of resources into it. 4:11 The next is you get to learn from real users. So it allows you to collect insights from early users which then turn into iterations and improve improvements that you can make on the product based on real world usage. 4:26 So one thing to note here is like, you can make a prototype, a static prototype, and that might be good to get like high level ideas and user feedback about how you're thinking about building the product. 4:38 But not until you actually build the MVP and release it to real users and have them literally use it on their own will you learn how they're actually thinking about it? 4:51 And learn on a bigger scale with a hundred users instead of ten users and actually if they're completing the core actions that you want them to complete. 5:00 And then finally resource optimization. By focusing on the most essential features, you can prioritize and make sure that your development efforts are actually used effectively and on the most important things. 5:13 So what are the overall steps to actually launch an MVP out in the real world? So number one, you want to define the core value proposition. 5:22 The primary problem your product aims to solve and the key features that will deliver this value to users. Your product may ultimately end up solving a number of different problems, maybe dozens of problems, but just think, what is the most important, the primary problem that you aim to solve? 5:42 And then, what features are necessary to solve that one problem? Next, prioritize the features. So list out all the possible features and prioritize them based on their importance to the core value prop. 5:56 Focus on what is essential for the MVP. Then you're going to actually develop the MVP, so you're going to work with a designer and maybe an engineer. 6:02 Definitely engineers to build a functional version of the product with prioritized features. You want to keep development time and costs as low as possible. 6:12 So, when something comes up, think, is this scope creep? Is this going to add more time into the development process and timeline that we don't actually know? 6:23 Okay, now you've developed the MVP, now you want to launch it and test it with users. So, launch the MVP to a select group of early adopters and get feedback from them on the experience. 6:35 Really, during this process, you want to focus on the product's ability to deliver the value, to solve the core and primary needs. 6:43 And then finally, iterate and improve. Okay, you've launched, you're testing it, you're getting these insights, now analyze the feedback. Identify different ways to improve it. 6:54 Prioritize what are the most important things that we should improve on. And then repeat this product until the product meets user expectation and market needs and you feel that your product is in a good spot to then start actually releasing it and sharing it with the broader market. 7:12 So an example here of an MVP. So suppose a product manager is developing a new project management tool. They first want to identify the core value prop which is helping teams collaborate effectively on projects. 7:26 Okay, next, they're going to prioritize features like task assignment, file sharing and communication. Like those are the three most important features to solve this problem. 7:35 Then they're going to develop an MVP with just those features. They'll test the product with a group of early users and get feedback from those users about if it's actually helping them to manage their projects. 7:49 Finally, they're going to refine the product before really deciding to launch it to a broader market. Actually send it out to lots of users, get lots of users into the product and using it. 8:01 So in conclusion, building an MVP is a big part of the problem. MVP is really important in this zero to one process because it allows PMs to test the ideas that they have with real users, get feedback from real people out there and then refine the product before investing significant resources months 8:19 or years of development efforts into the product. So by following the the steps outlined in this lesson, you can build and launch an MVP with your team. 8:28 You can optimize your resource allocation and then ultimately why are we doing this? It's, it's going to increase the chances that our product is actually successful. 8:37 All right, I'll see you in the next lesson.","Learn how to define, prioritize, build, launch, and iterate an MVP so you can validate a product idea with real users before investing heavily.",37c47eb8-6a27-4f5b-8e1e-54609713f7ea,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Building a minimum viable product (MVP),9.3,TRUE,9,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:50.075743+00
ec1dbbe4097542aaae0205c2d83afb37,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over early stage customer acquisition and growth strategies. Okay, so you've built and refined your MVP and the next step is to acquire customers and actually grow your user base. 0:13 So in this lesson, I'm going to go over different early stage customer acquisition and growth strategies that can really help you reach and engage your customers. 0:20 So number one thing to do here is to define your target audience and this has been done in previous lessons, but before you we dive into like actual strategies to get the customers, it's important that you identify who is the target audience. 0:36 You will need to understand their needs, their preferences, their behaviors online and offline. To ensure that your marketing efforts actually resonate with him, with them. 0:44 So here are some different channels for early stage customer acquisition. Content marketing, social media, public relations PR could be really effective. 0:54 Search engine optimization, paid advertising, search you know, whether it's Google ads, et cetera, email marketing, and partnerships. I'll let you pause on the screen to actually read each of these and understand you know, different aspects to all of them. 1:10 But all of these different channels are options for you and your team to actually get those early stage users. So understand that your user's background. 1:19 Who are they? Where are they? Are they hanging out? You know, do they read the news or do they not? 1:24 Do they use social media or do they not? Do they search things on Google or are they trying to find things out from word of mouth? 1:30 Try to think about these things and then tailor them to the different channels to try to figure out what is going to be most effective to get these users. 1:39 Okay. Here's some growth hacking techniques. So growth hacking is just like a mindset that focuses on rapid experimentation and iteration to identify the best ways to actually grow a business. 1:53 So some different techniques include number one virality. So encourage users to actually share your product with others. And incentivize this in some way. 2:03 So like if someone shares a product that you may give them a discount or access to exclusive features if they're able to refer a friend. 2:11 So this is really popular on Uber, for example, or food delivery apps. If you refer people and get them to order food that you get $10. 2:21 Or you get $10 off a ride. The freemium pricing model. So you could offer a free version of your product with limited features and this gets them into the product. 2:31 You're engaging them and then you get them to upgrade to a paid plan for that additional functionality. The next is gamification. 2:40 Gamification is a whole world out there and there's some interesting books on it, but you could use elements of game design like points, badges, leaderboards to engage users and encourage the desired behaviors like sharing your product or inviting friends. 2:55 There's some apps that do this really well and, and some you don't even know that they're actually doing it, but they are. 3:01 So then you want to measure and optimize your efforts. So track KPIs along this effort to assess whether or not you're being effective with each strategy. 3:11 So you want to monitor metrics like, okay, how much website traffic are we actually bringing in? Are we bringing in 100 users per day in this way or 1000? 3:21 Conversion rates. So say we deploy three different channels. Okay for channel one, are we, you know, maybe our conversion rate is 5%. 3:31 Maybe channel two is 10%. And maybe channel three is 30% conversion rate. Okay, obviously, channel three is the most effective and we're not, we're gonna want a poor resources. 3:41 Monetary resources into that channel. Also consider cost per acquisition, which we've gone over in previous lessons. An example here is that a startup may be developing a language learning app and it might use a combination of content marketing, social media, PR, and partnerships to attract 3:59 those early users. They could also implement a referral. Furl program for people who come in from content marketing or social media, et cetera, to then incentivize those users to invite other friends and create a freemium model to encourage the users to upgrade to a paid plan. 4:15 So in conclusion, there are a bunch of different customer acquisitions and strategies that you could deploy. And these play a really important role in, in generating you know, excitement and traffic for your product. 4:30 So by leveraging these techniques, you can reach your target audience and get them onto your platform and month over month, week over week, month over month, grow your user base. 4:39 So remember that while you are trying to get users onto the platform, you're going to want to continually look at the data, go back to what is the data telling us, what are the best channels what are the best mechanisms, gamification or, or growth hacking techniques that, that we've tested 4:58 out to, to grow our user base. And then you're going to want to invest more in those. So in the next lesson we'll go over how to iterate and refine your product based on user feedback.","Learn how to choose, test, and optimize early-stage acquisition channels and growth tactics so you can grow your user base efficiently.",d9d12a5e-d66c-44b7-bcf7-79381c101c38,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Early-stage customer acquisition / growth,9.4,TRUE,6,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:50.640867+00
9673d7741b64407dab52d9c54d83b626,"0:00 In this lesson, I'm going to go over iterating and refining the product based on user feedback that you're actually getting. 0:07 In the world of product development, user feedback is invaluable. It helps you figure out what is working, what is not working, and then where are improvements that we can make? 0:18 You know, can we make anything more seamless? Can we make anything more valuable? So in this lesson, I'm going to go over the importance of iterating and refining the product, especially in this zero to one phase, to ensure continuous improvement that over time you're better meeting your customer's 0:34 needs. So the biggest way to do this is to collect feedback in a number of different ways, and we've gone over these in previous lessons, but just to reiterate during the zero to one phase you could deploy surveys. 0:46 So create different surveys, send them to the users in your that initial target market gather insights from them on their experience and preferences, and then make changes in your product based on their survey results. 0:58 You could do in-app feedback. So across your product, you could, you could have little pop-ups or different ways to allow your users to give you feedback on their, you know, their thoughts report issues, stuff like that. 1:11 You could do customer interviews. So you can do one-on-one interviews with your users to deep dive into their experience and get more detailed feedback. 1:19 This is really important to do in the zero to one phase. Because you basically don't even know what they're thinking in their heads because it's so new. 1:26 You could do usability testing. So you could observe users interacting with your product to identify different issues and areas for improvement. 1:34 Things that you thought were working but when you're actually seeing them use it, you, you, you literally see with your eyes ways that it could be easier. 1:42 Ways that are causing issues or confusion with your user base. And then finally, online reviews and social media. People are very honest online, unfortunately. 1:50 Fortunately and unfortunately. And they will let you know if your product is bad. They will literally spell it out for you. 1:57 And, and you might have to do some digging and then fur from what they're saying, but typically they will be vocal online about what they're thinking about your product. 2:06 Analyzing user feedback. So once you've collected the feedback, it's then important to analyze it, categorize it identify common trend like themes, trends, issues from it. 2:16 So you could have all this raw data and it's important to take that raw data and, and really turn it into something actionable. 2:25 Then you can find patterns in the feedback and prioritize areas that are important to do right now that would have the most significant impact on user satisfaction. 2:34 And then later on you can once you have additional time, you can address the things that may not be as important or, or as, or a bit. 2:42 So iterate and refine your product. So based on the analysis that you've done with gathering your user feedback, you want to then make data driven decisions to improve your product. 2:53 So a couple of different ways that you might be able to do this. So number one, you might might be able to, and want to fix bugs and address technical issues. 3:01 So no one wants to use a buggy product or a slow product. So you want to address any bugs that have been reported or technical problems to ensure that your product and software is functioning properly. 3:12 It's, it's, it's delivering a seamless user experience. Next, update features or functionality. So you might want to enhance or modify existing features that you've launched based on the web. The feedback that you've been getting to better meet their needs and expectations. 3:26 So if users are continually saying that they wish that this one feature could do this one thing, do that thing. 3:33 And then it's almost that easy. But do that thing and don't do something else that may be a distraction. You, you also may want to consider adding new features. 3:41 So if someone says like a whole part of the experience is completely lacking and people can't fully complete their tasks, you may want to build a new feature to address that specifically. 3:53 You might want to improve the UX and the UI design. So updating this based on feedback will ultimately create a more intuitive enjoyment. 4:04 Every, you know, to create an actual seamless user experience, it takes a lot of time. And so maybe you want to decide that, okay, for our MVP, we are going to launch kind of a bare bones UI, bare bones user experience. 4:17 You know, it won't have all the bells and whistles. It won't look the prettiest, but it will get the job done. 4:21 And then over time, you can improve it. You can make it easier and better. And then finally revising onboarding and user education. 4:28 This is a great way that if, you know, users are reporting difficulty understanding your product or getting started in that first session or first couple of sessions, you might want to consider updating your onboarding experience to include more educational materials, really help them and get them to 4:46 the point at which they see value. Then you want to communicate product updates to users. This is a really big one. 4:53 Keep your users informed about what you're actually doing. Send them, you know, a monthly email, you know, every two weeks, an email, a newsletter calend. 5:04 It demonstrates to your user base that you actually value your feedback and make changes based on it. And when you show that you actually care about their feedback, users are going to be much more likely to actually give you feedback. 5:17 No one wants to just, you know, talk into the void. They want to know that if they do get feedback, it'll actually be read, analyzed, and taken into account and then, you know, the product will change based on it. 5:29 So email newsletters is a big one, in-app notifications to announce a new piece of functionality, or blog posts, social media, etc. 5:37 Those are different ways to announce updates to your users. Another example here is an e-commerce platform could receive feedback from users, you know, indicating difficulty navigating the website, and locating specific types of products. 5:51 So the team may analyze that feedback, identify areas for improvement, and iterate on the user experience to create a more intuitive navigation system. 6:00 Then, once they do that, they communicate the changes to users. So, in conclusion, iterating and refining your product based on the feedback you're getting is really important for continually improving and getting your products to a place where it's really successful, especially for 0 to 1 products 6:33 . So, collect, analyze, act on this user feedback, make sure you're using data to inform the decisions that you're making and enhance your product. 6:41 And in doing so, you are going to be able to do that. You are going to foster customer satisfaction and loyalty and this will ultimately help your product and company to be successful overall. 6:51 Alright, thanks for watching.","Learn how to collect, analyze, and act on user feedback to iteratively improve your product so you can boost user satisfaction and retention.",4d866e17-9be4-4bca-a9d0-fb78245ce10a,1fc43dc5-0a00-4600-a2bd-9ed8c250f4df,Iterating product based on user feedback,9.5,TRUE,7,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:51.14993+00
cd0c4a7926774d7db4c4c7b0a6168224,"00:00 In this lesson, we're going to go over what is a product portfolio exactly and why do you need it? So what is a product portfolio? 00:08 It's basically a collection of work that showcases a product manager's experience, skills, and accomplishments. It really is providing you and future employers with a comprehensive overview of the projects you've worked on in the past, some problems you've solved, and outcomes you've achieved. 00:26 These are a couple of the things that product managers would do on a daily basis in their job. They're completing projects. 00:33 They are solving problems with technology and they're ideally achieving certain outcomes. It's in product management outcomes are more important than output. 00:45 So anytime that you can highlight an outcome that you've achieved, the better. For example, it's not as impressive that you launched a specific feature. 00:54 It's more impressive that you launch that feature and it increased a metric or earned revenue for the company, et cetera. 01:03 The third is that it really helps to communicate how you think about solving problems. So what is your step-by-step process look like? 01:11 Because when a hiring manager is checking out your portfolio, they're trying to evaluate if you solve problems in a way that could be consistent in with how their company solves problems. 01:23 They want to see you doing a step-by-step approach and not jumping to solutions, for example. And this is something that you can really demonstrate well with your portfolio. 01:34 So all in all, think of it as a way to really uniquely demonstrate your value as a PM to future potential employers. 01:44 So what are the parts of a product portfolio? There really are four parts in general. There is an intro, there is, and that's basically a short intro that summarizes who you are at the beginning of your portfolio. 01:59 There's an about section, so this is a more in-depth description of who you are, your past experiences, and what you're passionate about work, so this can be kind of broken down. 02:10 There's work experiences, there's case studies, and there's side projects, and in this training in these videos, we're going to go through in detail what to put in each of these sections, and then the fourth is a contact page. 02:24 So these are ways to get in touch with you and explore more, for example, a LinkedIn is really important to link on your portfolio so that if someone gets there from your resume, for example, or an email, they can go to your portfolio and then easily get to your LinkedIn as well, and that's very familiar 02:46 way for hiring managers to evaluate candidates. So why do you actually need a portfolio? So the main one is it gives you a really strong competitive advantage. 02:58 Product manager jobs are hard to get. Lots of people are applying to these jobs, and there's typically only one product manager and opening per team. 03:08 And this is, this can be compared to software engineers who really could be placed on any team as long as they're, if they're a front end engineer, as long as there's front end engineer positions open on a team, they could be placed on any team. 03:25 And typically there are many software engineers per team, in some cases like three to seven engineers on a team. So as you can imagine, if you have four product and engineering teams in a company, four times five means there's 20 software engineer positions open, but only four product manager positions 03:45 open. So at any given time, there are not a lot of openings within a company. So these jobs are hard to get. 03:53 Additionally, companies are looking for candidates to have what I call the four vector fit. it. So the first vector here is the role. 04:03 There's different specializations within product management. So you could be a mobile product manager. And that's a PM who works on native apps like iOS and Android apps. 04:12 You could be a platform engineer. And this is a sorry, a platform PM. And this is a product manager who works on a platform team in a company. 04:22 And the platform teams are responsible for basically developing technology and infrastructure for other teams within the company to be able to launch new features. 04:34 You could be a growth product manager and this product manager is really in charge of increasing core metrics at the top of the funnel. 04:43 So like getting more users to sign up, to subscribe, to engage in a certain way, etc. The second vector is technology. 04:53 So one of these technologies is native mobile. It's definitely different when developing an app versus developing a website. Apps are released maybe once a week, once every two weeks. 05:07 You have to really be sure that the features are launching work well and won't crash the app, because a lot of people don't automatically update their apps. 05:18 So there's a different nuances when it comes to mobile apps. So, companies may look for a PM who has had experience there already. 05:27 Another is a web product manager. So a large majority of product managers work on web, so that's desktop, web and mobile web, so you can think of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, et cetera. 05:41 Machine learning is a big one, so you might have a product manager who is really knowledgeable about what machine learning or artificial intelligence can do, the capabilities, its limitations, et cetera. 05:55 And so a company may be looking for that specifically. For example, Spotify, if Spotify is hiring a product manager to work on the team responsible for the algorithm that recommends music to people, they may want a product manager who really specializes in machine learning. 06:13 The next vector is industry. So what background do you what industry background do you have do you have like experience in the finance world in which case you can go and work at a FinTech company do you have experience in medicine or health care health insurance then maybe you'd be a great fit for a 06:34 health care tech company ecommerce maybe you have past experience with physical products or digital products and and you'd work well at an e-commerce company. 06:46 So industry is an important one because especially for people looking to transition into a product manager role, if you're really experienced in a specific area like education or healthcare, you're gonna be able to stand out from the crowd when applying to those specific types of company. 07:07 And then the last is business model. So there's a bunch of different business models that a company could have, whether it's a subscription service, like Spotify or Netflix, freemium, licensing, SaaS, B2B, B2C, there's a bunch of different business models that a company could have. 07:26 And if you have prior experience working with one, you may have a leg up on other candidates. For example, like if you have worked in a marketplace like Airbnb, you may be able to kind of translate that skill set to work at another company like Seaky that has a marketplace for tickets. 07:48 So all these four vector fits basically are important because companies really want their product management hires to start the job and hit the ground running. 08:00 So if they have prior experience in any of these areas, it makes them a much stronger candidate. So a product portfolio can really be a key differentiator in this competitive job market for PMs. 08:15 It really helps people stand out from the pack. The second reason why you need a portfolio is that it really helps to visually represent your skill set. 08:27 Product is very visual. What we work on ends up on a screen for users to interact with. With a portfolio, you can represent your expertise in a concise, structured, visual format. 08:39 making it super easy for potential employers to quickly understand your skills and the value that you can bring to their team. 08:47 Unlike a LinkedIn or a resume, the portfolios are really a way to visually represent all the work that you've done in the past and all the work you can do in the future. 08:58 It can demonstrate your ability to work on a array of products, identify and solve complex problems, and deliver successful outcomes so maybe you have a history working at in a B2C company that's that's mainly targeting consumers and consumers regular people but you have aspirations to work at in a B2B 09:22 company where the tech company is selling software to a business in order to really effectively prove that you that, you might want to put a case study on your portfolio for a B2B company. 09:37 So despite having just B2C experience in your professional life, if you put a case study up, focusing on B2B, that communicates to featuring hiring managers that you can actually do the job at a B2B company as well. 09:55 So there's two types of portfolios really. There's there's ones with when the candidates have prior experience and then there's ones with the candidates don't have prior experience Prior experience meaning like they've already been a product manager or associate product manager and they're trying to 10:12 get another role Whereas candidates with no prior experience Means that you haven't been been a product manager yet. So for candidates with prior experience It's acceptable and sufficient to just include screenshots or short summaries of past features. 10:31 You've shipped in previous roles and you don't necessarily need to go as in-depth as you would in a case study, but it doesn't hurt and it can only help if you do. 10:42 And the reason for this is that because you've already worked as a product manager, you've gotten over that hump, that first step to get into the product management world. 10:51 So companies don't need to see as much evidence that you can do the job. Now on the flip side, candidates with no prior experience, this might be, you know, you are a data analyst and you're looking to transition in or a, you know, you work in customer support and you're looking to transition in. 11:10 In this case, your portfolio should be pretty in depth to demonstrate that you can actually do the job of a product manager from beginning to end. 11:20 It's really the only way to really demonstrate this ability before the interview itself. During the interview process, you'll be able to communicate your skill set, but just getting that interview is a big hurdle, with only 2-3% of applicants getting an interview. 11:38 So the portfolio acts as a really great way to represent that skill and ability before the interview. Now, just going to go over two quick examples of what an online portfolio actually ends up looking like. 11:55 So I'm going to first go through mine. So at the top here we have kind of this intro section that has a nice professional headshot with a short blurb about who I am and what I'm really interested in. 12:09 I have quick links to different social media profiles and a quick summary of the roles that I've had. Next, I have an about me section where I go much more in depth about my background, what I'm passionate about, etc. 12:25 and link to different pages on my site. Next I have the my work section. This is outlining the past roles that I've had with links, every one of these links to a specific page that goes more in depth for those past jobs. 12:40 I have a side project section so each one of these goes to different projects I've had in the past that I've done on the side kind of outside of my my job and then finally at the bottom I have some case studies. 12:55 So these are really going in depth with a specific product and problem and going through the product development process with each of these. 13:06 So you can see you know just to show a quick example is this is one of the side projects that I had. 13:14 So just briefly touching on the different features and how it worked. For work, we can look at a more in-depth page that demonstrates the features that I launched and a little bit more information about them. 13:29 For the case studies, I'm going really in-depth end-to-end providing context, hypothesis, market, audience, et cetera. and we'll go much more in-depth here and then finally a contact page to make it super easy for people to actually contact me. 13:46 Now if we go to another product manager's portfolio, this one is really great. It has a clean design. Similarly, you can click into different projects or positions in the past. 14:03 It outlines their role what they did with it. And it really helps people to better understand, you know, who is this person? 14:12 How can I get in touch with them? And it really acts as a, again, visual representation of someone who is aspiring to be a product manager. 14:23 So with that being said, this is what you will be creating in this course. By the end of it, you should have a product portfolio built out and ready to share on your LinkedIn and with all your job applications. 14:35 So that being said, let's get into the next lesson.",Learn how to define a product manager portfolio and structure it into key sections so you can showcase outcomes and stand out in PM job applications.,36112c2e-95de-4d7b-85d9-476e65cdc48f,2ea1d12c-910f-4656-aa23-4d633f0ff0a2,What is a portfolio & why do you need it?,1,FALSE,15,2025-11-15 13:35:19.938425+00,2025-12-26 20:06:53.573632+00
